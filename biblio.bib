abstract = {The purpose of the present note is to contribute to analysis of bed-load transport processes within a Lagrangian framework. Experiments were performed tracking individual particles under different bed conditions (mobile and fixed beds) at transitional hydrodynamic regimes. A new image processing procedure was designed to obtain the coordinates of each moving sediment within the intermediate range of scales (corresponding to a particle trajectory between rests periods). Thorough attention has been paid to provide consistent definitions for particle motion and trajectory, as well as to devise a rigorous method for analysis. A data set with properties of more than 4000 intermediate trajectories was obtained. Collected data were used to estimate stream-wise and transversal length and duration of intermediate trajectories and corresponding mean sediment velocities. Statistical significance of the values obtained for measured properties was ascertained by appropriate analysis. The full data set is provided with the manuscript as supplementary material.},

Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {The morphology of an alluvial river channel affects the movement of water and sediment along it, but in the longer run is shaped by those processes. This interplay has mostly been investigated empirically within the paradigm of Newtonian mechanics. In rivers, this has created an emphasis on equilibrium configurations with simple morphology and uniform steady flow. But transient adjustment, whether between equilibrium states or indefinitely, is to be expected in a world in which hydrology, sediment supply, and base level are not fixed. More fundamentally, water flows and all the phenomena that accompany them are inherently unsteady, and flows in natural channels are characteristically nonuniform. The morphodynamics of alluvial river channels is the striking consequence. In this paper, we develop the essential connection between the episodic nature of bed material transport and the production of river morphology, emphasizing the fundamental problems of sediment transport, the role of bar evolution in determining channel form, the role of riparian vegetation, and the wide range of time scales for change. As the key integrative exercise, we emphasize the importance of physics-based modeling of morphodynamics. We note consequences that can be of benefit to society if properly understood. These include the possibility to better be able to model how varying flows drive morphodynamic change, to understand the influence of the sediments themselves on morphodynamics, and to recognize the inherent necessity for rivers that transport bed material to deform laterally. We acknowledge pioneering contributions in WRR and elsewhere that have introduced some of these themes.},

abstract = {Experiments are reported on the dynamics of a bed of particles sheared by a viscous Couette flow in an annular channel, with emphasis on the distributions of particle velocities, durations and lengths of the small saltation flights, and surface density of the moving particles. The velocity distributions are shown to decay approximately exponentially, with mean value, U-p, equal to 0.1 gammad, where gamma is the shear rate and d is the particle diameter. The duration of the flights does not depend on the shear rate, and is equal to 15 times the settling time d/V-s, where V-s is the Stokes settling velocity. Starting from an initially loosely packed bed, the surface density of the moving particles, N-p, was observed to decrease slowly over several days, unlike their velocity which remains constant with time. This decay is related to the increase of the threshold shear rate for particle motion, and corresponds to rearrangement of the particles near the bed surface (armouring). When the stationary state is reached, Np depends linearly on the shear rate, so that the particle flow rate, Q(p)=NpUp, is a quadratic function of the shear rate. Two theoretical models are proposed to account for these observations. In the first one, the erosion and deposition rates are modelled using the two hydrodynamic time scales: the inverse shear rate gamma(-1) for the erosion rate, and the settling time d/V-s for the deposition rate. This model accounts for the linear dependence of Np on the shear rate. The second model was developed to capture the slow decrease of N-p, by considering the trapping of moving particles into troughs of the bed. This trapping model does recover the main features observed experimentally, although the characteristic time for the decrease of Np still remains too short. Our observations are, finally, compared to existing numerical and experimental studies on turbulent flows.},

abstract = {A common approach for estimating the bed load transport rate in gravel-bed streams is to relate it to deterministic channel-averaged driving parameters and corresponding resistance properties of the bed material. Notwithstanding the proven success of this approach in modeling various morphodynamic scenarios, it does not contain the mechanics necessary to relate the bulk sediment transport rate to the displacement patterns of individual particles. Experiments on entrainment, transport, and deposition of tracer stones in a flume described here were designed to address this issue. Predictors of statistics of bed elevation fluctuations at short timescales, total and elevation-specific particle entrainment rates, particle step lengths, mean and associated probability density function for particle virtual velocity, and thickness of the active layer were developed. The working hypothesis tested in this paper is that the statistics of tracer displacements can be related to channel-averaged hydraulic parameters, and thus linked to macroscopic aspects of bed load transport.},

@article{Pelosi2014,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).Here we consider the 1-D morphodynamics of an erodible bed subject to bedload transport. Fluvial bed elevation variation is typically modeled by the Exner equation, which, in its classical form, expresses mass conservation in terms of the divergence of the bedload sediment flux. An entrainment form of the Exner equation can be written as an alternative description of the same bedload processes, by introducing the notions of an entrainment rate into bedload and of a particle step length, and assuming a certain probability distribution for the step length. This entrainment form implies some degree of nonlocality, which is absent from the standard flux form, so that these two expressions, which are different ways to look at same conservation principle (i.e., sediment continuity), may no longer become equivalent in cases when channel complexity and flow conditions allow for long particle saltation steps (including, but not limited to the case where particle step length has a heavy tailed distribution) or when the domain of interest is not long compared to the step length (e.g., laboratory scales, or saltation over relatively smooth surfaces). We perform a systematic analysis of the effects of the nonlocality in the entrainment form of the Exner equation on transient aggradational/degradational bed profiles by using the flux form as a benchmark. As expected, the two forms converge to the same results as the step length converges to zero, in which case nonlocality is negligible. As step length increases relative to domain length, the mode of aggradation changes from an upward-concave form to a rotational, and then eventually a downward-concave form. Corresponding behavior is found for the case of degradation. These results may explain anomalously flat, aggradational, long profiles that have been observed in some short laboratory flume experiments.},

abstract = {This paper summarizes the results of an experimental study on the influence of an external turbulence field on the bed load sediment transport in an open channel. The external turbulence was generated by (1) a horizontal pipe placed halfway through the depth h; (2) a series of grids with a clearance of about one-third of the depth from the bed, and extending over a finite length of the flume; and (3) a series of grids with a clearance in the range (0.1-1.0) h from the bed, but extending over the entire length of the flume. Two kinds of experiments were conducted: plane-bed experiments and ripple-covered-bed experiments. In the former case, the flow in the presence of the turbulence generator was adjusted so that the mean bed shear stress was the same as in the case without the turbulence generator in order to single out the effect of the external turbulence on the sediment transport. In the ripple-covered-bed case, the mean and turbulence quantities of the streamwise component of the velocity were measured, and the Shields parameter, due to skin friction, was determined. The Shields parameter, together with the RMS value of the streamwise velocity fluctuations, was correlated with the sediment transport rate. The sediment transport increases markedly with increasing turbulence level.},

abstract = {Assessing hydromorphological and floristic patterns along a regulated Mediterranean river: The Serpis River (Spain) In the European context, several methodologies have been developed to assess the ecological status and, specifically, the hydromorphological status of running surface waters. Although these methodologies have been widely used, few studies have focused on hydrologically altered water bodies and the factors that may determine their status. In this study, the Serpis River was divided into 16 segments from the Beniarres dam (40 km from the river mouth) to the sea, all of which are affected by flow regulation, but with different severity. In each segment, an inventory of the flora was conducted, and hydromorphological indices (QBR, Riparian Habitat Quality Index; and IHF, River Habitat Index) were applied. The objectives of the study were (A) to identify relationships between floristic composition and QBR components and (B) between instream habitat characteristics and IHF components as well as (C) to determine the main factors controlling the floristic composition and riparian habitat quality (QBR) and the factors controlling instream habitat characteristics and heterogeneity (IHF). A cluster analysis allowed grouping sites according to their floristic composition and instream habitat characteristics, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was used to ordinate the sites, obtaining the biotic and instream habitat characteristics, as well as the QBR and IHF subindices, which better explained the spatial patterns. Finally, a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) with predictor variables (geographical, hydrological, geomorphological and human pressures) indicated the main factors controlling the spatial patterns of the floristic composition, instream habitat characteristics, riparian habitat quality and instream habitat heterogeneity. A gradient of riparian and instream habitat quality was identified. Our results suggest that physical constraints (presence of a gorge) have protected sites from severe human impacts, resulting in good ecological quality, despite hydrological alteration. This area, where there is geomorphological control, could be potentially reclassified into a different ecotype because regular monitoring could be using incorrect references for index scores, and naturally high scores could be confused with recovery from hydrological alteration or other pressures. The sites with the worst quality were near the river mouth and were characterised by an artificial and highly variable flow regime (related to large autumnal floods and frequent human-induced periods of zero flow). This artificial flow variability as well as the presence of lateral structures in the river channel and geomorphological characteristics were identified as the main factors driving the hydromorphological and floristic pattern in this regulated river.},

abstract = {We recognize three primary channel-reach substrates: bedrock, alluvium, and colluvium. Bedrock reaches lack a contiguous alluvial bed and reflect high transport capacities relative to sediment supply; they are typically con-fined by valley walls and have steep slopes. In contrast, alluvial channels ex-hibit a wide variety of morphologies and roughness configurations that vary with slope and position within the channel network, and may be either con-fined, with little to no associated flood plain, or unconfined, with a well-established flood plain. We recognize five distinct alluvial reach morpholo-gies: cascade, step pool, plane bed, pool riffle, and dune ripple. Colluvial channels form an additional reach type that we recognize separately from alluvial channels, despite the common presence of a thin alluvial substrate. Colluvial channels typically are small headwater streams that flow over a colluvial valley fill and exhibit weak or ephemeral fluvial transport. Each of these channel types is distinguished by a distinctive channel-bed morphol-ogy, allowing rapid visual classification. Diagnostic features of each chan-nel type are summarized in Table 1 and discussed below. Cascade Channels The term " cascade " connotes tumbling flow, although its specific mor-phologic definition varies and often is applied to both channel units and reaches (e.g., Bisson et al., 1982; Grant et al., 1990). Our delineation of cas-cade channels focuses on streams in which energy dissipation is dominated by continuous tumbling and jet-and-wake flow over and around individual large clasts (e.g., Peterson and Mohanty, 1960) (Fig. 1A). Cascade channels generally occur on steep slopes, are narrowly confined by valley walls, and are characterized by longitudinally and laterally disorganized bed material typically consisting of cobbles and boulders (Fig. 2A). Small, partially channel-spanning pools spaced less than a channel width apart are common in cascade channels. Tumbling flow over individual grain steps and turbu-lence associated with jet-and-wake flow around grains dissipates much of the mechanical energy of the flow (Fig. 3A). Large particle size relative to flow depth makes the largest bed-forming material of cascade reaches effectively immobile during typical flows. Stud-ies of steep-gradient channels report that large bed-forming grains typically become mobile only during infrequent (i.e., 50–100 yr) hydrologic events (Grant et al., 1990; Kondolf et al., 1991; Whittaker, 1987b). Mobilization of these larger clasts is accompanied by high sediment transport rates due to the release of finer sediment trapped under and around large grains (Sawada et al., 1983; Warburton, 1992). During lesser floods, gravel stored in low en-ergy sites is mobilized and travels as bedload over larger bed-forming clasts (Griffiths, 1980; Schmidt and Ergenzinger, 1992). Gravel and finer material are locally stored on stoss and lee sides of flow obstructions (i.e., large grains and large woody debris) due to physical impoundment and genera-tion of velocity shadows. One tracer study (Kondolf et al., 1991) showed that material in such depositional sites was completely mobilized during a seven-year recurrence-interval event, whereas no tracer movement was ob-served during flows of less than the annual recurrence interval. These observations suggest that there are two thresholds for sediment trans-port in cascade channels. During moderate recurrence-interval flows, bedload material is rapidly and efficiently transported over the more stable bed-form-ing clasts, which have a higher mobility threshold corresponding to more in-frequent events. The lack of significant in-channel storage (Kondolf et al., 1991) and the rapid scour of depositional sites during moderately frequent high flows suggest that sediment transport is effectively supply limited in cas-cade channels. Bedload transport studies demonstrate that steep channels in mountain drainage basins are typically supply limited, receiving seasonal or stochastic sediment inputs (Nanson, 1974; Griffiths, 1980; Ashida et al., 1981; Whittaker, 1987). Because of this high transport capacity relative to sediment supply, cascade channels function primarily as sediment transport zones that rapidly deliver sediment to lower-gradient channels.},

abstract = {Bedforms in gravel-bed rivers range in size from 10-2 to 103 m and have a wide range of affects on sediment transport and channel stability. To study the affect of these bedforms on sediment transport a classification scheme is proposed that breaks the bedforms into micro, meso, macro and megaforms. Then using two creeks in British Columbia and one in California, the trend of sediment transport rates is related to the bed state, sediment and wood storage and the associated bedforms are discussed. At small spatial and temporal scales (micro/mesoform scales), variability in sediment transport rate can be ascribed to the changing state of the bed, which largely depends on the sediment supply regime. Stabilizing bedforms develop when sediment supply is low, and reduces the depth of the bed active layer and the mobility of the grains, thereby decreasing the sediment transport rate. Sediment rating relations in a low sediment supply channel are steep and are believed to be extremely sensitive to small changes in sediment supply and flow regime when compared to higher sediment supply systems. High sediment supply suppresses the development of stabilizing bedforms and increases the mobility of grains and the depth of the active layer. At the reach scale (macroform scale), high sediment mobility is shown to produce complex cycles of aggradation and degradation that can persist for decades. In-channel woody debris can strongly influence the timing and magnitude of these aggradation-degradation cycles and also has an important effect on the development of megaforms. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Two water recirculating sediment feed flumes were used: one with a 6 m long and 0.15 m wide channel and other with an 11 m long channel with widths of 0.74 m and 0.53 m. The sediment, poorly sorted gravel with a mean size of 3 mm, was fed at the upstream end of the channel at steady rates from 0.03 kg s{\&}{\#}8722;1 m{\&}{\#}8722;1 to 1.0 kg s{\&}{\#}8722;1 m{\&}{\#}8722;1. Sediment transport rate out of the channel varied in all runs, at approximate periods of 3 min in the runs with high transport rates to 14 min in the runs with low transport rates. The runs with low transport rates also showed fluctuations in total transport rate at periods of about 25 min. Transport rates of each size fraction varied with time in a distinctive pattern in all runs. The time variations were caused by the migration of very long and low bed load sheets in the runs with low to moderate transport rates and dunelike bed forms in the run with the highest transport rate. The bed surface in all runs was coarser in size than the original sediment mix except that with the highest transport rate (run H5) in which the size distribution was nearly the same as the original.},

abstract = {This paper examines the importance of particle diffusion relative to advection in bedload transport. Particle diffusion is not included in existing approaches to bedload transport. Based on recent advances in the probabilistic theory of sediment transport, this paper emphasizes the part played by particle diffusion in bedload transport. The proposed model consists of the classic Saint-Venant–Exner equations supplemented by an advection–diffusion equation for particle activity (solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area). The model is solved numerically using standard finite-volume techniques. Our numerical simulations consider two case studies: (i) bed degradation under subcritical flow conditions and (ii) anti-dune development in supercritical flows on sloping gravel beds. These simulations show that particle diffusion plays a key role in bedload transport under non-uniform flow conditions. The diffusive sediment transport rate may be as large as the advective transport rate. When anti-dunes develop and migrate upstream, particle diffusion can create fluctuations in the sediment transport rate, whose amplitude compares with the capacity transport rate. Non-uniform flows can be characterized by a typical length, referred to as the adaptation length, which represents the distance that a particle dislodged from the bed travels before it reaches steady-state velocity. We show that the adaptation length is controlled by the particle advection velocity, particle diffusivity, and entrainment/deposition rates, but is independent of the bedform wavelength (contrary to common belief). For simulating bed degradation and anti-dune migration in gravel-bed rivers, a benchmark analysis of different bedload transport models provides evidence that those including particle diffusion perform better than classic models.},

abstract = {In gravel-bed rivers, bedload transport exhibits considerable variability in time and space. Recently, stochastic bedload transport theories have been developed to address the mechanisms and effects of bedload transport fluctuations. Stochastic models involve parameters such as particle diffusivity, entrainment and deposition rates. The lack of hard information on how these parameters vary with flow conditions is a clear impediment to their application to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we determined the closure equations for the above parameters from laboratory experiments. We focused on shallow supercritical flow on a sloping mobile bed in straight channels, a setting that was representative of flow conditions in mountain rivers. Experiments were run at low sediment transport rates under steady nonuniform flow conditions (i.e., the water discharge was kept constant, but bedforms developed and migrated upstream, making flow nonuniform). Using image processing, we reconstructed particle paths to deduce the particle velocity and its probability distribution, particle diffusivity, and rates of deposition and entrainment. We found that on average, particle acceleration, velocity and deposition rate were responsive to local flow conditions, whereas entrainment rate depended strongly on local bed activity. Particle diffusivity varied linearly with the depth-averaged flow velocity. The empirical probability distribution of particle velocity was well approximated by a Gaussian distribution when all particle positions were considered together. In contrast, the particles located in close vicinity to the bed had exponentially distributed velocities. Our experimental results provide closure equations for stochastic or deterministic bedload transport models.},

abstract = {Grains of a single size within a mixed-size bed are entrained over a range of flows. Within this range some grains exposed on the bed surface are active (entrained at least once over the duration of a transport event), while the remaining surface grains are immobile, a condition we define as partial transport. We demonstrate the existence and domain of partial transport using observations of grain entrainment on time series of bed photographs of flume experiments with a widely sorted sand/gravel mixture. The active proportion of the bed surface increases with bed shear stress tau(0). At a given tau(0), 90{\%} of the active grains are entrained when the cumulative mass transported exceeds approximately 4 times the active mass on the bed. Mobilization of grains in a size fraction increases from 10{\%} to 90{\%} over a range of tau(0) of a factor of 2. The bounds of this range increase with grain size D-i so that at a given tau(0), sizes over a range of a factor of 4 are in a state of partial transport. Fractional transport rates are independent of D-i for fully mobilized fractions and decrease rapidly with D-i for partially mobile fractions. partial transport is associated with substantial transport rates of finer, fully mobile sizes, limits both the rate and size distribution of grain exchange with the bed subsurface, and may be the dominant transport condition in many gravel-bed rivers.},

It was shown in a companion paper [$\backslash$n                              $\backslash$n      Seminara et al., 2002$\backslash$n                              ], however, that the Bagnold hypothesis breaks down when applied to equilibrium bed load transport on beds with transverse$\backslash$n                              slopes above a relatively modest value that is well below the angle of repose. An investigation of this failure resulted in$\backslash$n                              a demonstration of its lack of validity even for nearly horizontal beds. The constraint is here replaced with an entrainment$\backslash$n                              formulation, according to which a dynamic equilibrium is maintained by a balance between entrainment of bed grains into the$\backslash$n                              bed load layer and deposition of bed load grains onto the bed. The entrainment function is formulated so that the entrainment$\backslash$n                              rate is an increasing function of the excess of the fluid shear stress at the bed over the threshold value. The formulation$\backslash$n                              is implemented with the aid of a unique set of laboratory data that characterizes equilibrium bed load transport at relatively$\backslash$n                              low shear stresses for streamwise angles of bed inclination varying from nearly 0° to 22°.

The entrainment formulation has the added advantage of not requiring the unrealistically high dynamic coefficient$\backslash$n                              of Coulomb friction resulting from the Bagnold constraint.

abstract = {An improved synthetic digital filtering method (SDFM) for the generation of equilibrium turbulence is described, with emphasis on the ease of application to complex configurations. This is achieved by facilitating the use of modeled (RANS) statistics for the mean flow and Reynolds stress profiles, instead of simulated (DNS or LES) statistics that are not readily available for three-dimensional flows. The effects on boundary layer relaxation with modeled statistics are first quantified for a well-known canonical situation, specifically, Mach 2 equilibrium turbulent boundary layers over 250 {\textless} Re$\theta${\textless} 2220. Various convergence criteria are assessed in terms of the streamwise coordinate (x) normalized by the incoming boundary layer thickness ($\delta$0). These include skin-friction, which requires x/$\delta$0≈ 12 for equilibrium, inner scale mean velocity (x/$\delta$0≈ 16), inner scale Reynolds stresses (x/$\delta$0≈ 18), as well as outer scale mean velocity, Reynolds stresses, and spatio-temporal correlations (x/$\delta$0≈ 40–50). Development lengths are shown to be inversely related to Reynolds number. In terms of boundary layer relaxation length, initializing the method with RANS (versus simulated) statistics incurs a negligible penalty in inner coordinates and a mild penalty (x/$\delta$0≈ 5–10) in outer coordinates. The effectiveness of this approach is then demonstrated by application to significantly more complex three-dimensional flows, including internal single and multi-stream flows, for which synthetic turbulence generation techniques are necessary, but precursor high-fidelity simulations are not available. Thus, the RANS-initialized SDFM provides a rapidly adaptable method for the synthetic generation of wall-bounded turbulence.},

abstract = {In this work we develop a reduced-complexity model (RCM) for river delta formation (referred to as DeltaRCM in the following). It is a rule-based cellular morphodynamic model, in contrast to reductionist models based on detailed computational fluid dynamics. The basic framework of this model (DeltaRCM) consists of stochastic parcel-based cellular routing schemes for water and sediment and a set of phenomenological rules for sediment deposition and erosion. The outputs of the model include a depth-averaged flow field, water surface elevation and bed topography that evolve in time. Results show that DeltaRCM is able (1) to resolve a wide range of channel dynamics – including elongation, bifurcation, avulsion and migration – and (2) to produce a variety of deltas such as alluvial fan deltas and deltas with multiple orders of bifurcations. We also demonstrate a simple stratigraphy recording component which tracks the distribution of coarse and fine materials and the age of the deposits. Essential processes that must be included in reduced-complexity delta models include a depth-averaged flow field that guides sediment transport a nontrivial water surface profile that accounts for backwater effects at least in the main channels, both bedload and suspended sediment transport, and topographic steering of sediment transport.},

abstract = {A fully divergence-free method is proposed for generation of inhomogeneous/anisotropic turbulence with large spatial variation. The method is based on the method of Smirnov et al., which is known to violate the divergence-free constraint when spatial variation of turbulence is present. In the proposed method a vector potential field is introduced; by taking the vector curl of the potential field one can generate a strictly divergence-free flow field. A novel formulation for scaling the vector potential field, together with a coordinate transformation strategy, is proposed in this work. The result is a six-step procedure for the generation of inhomogeneous turbulence fields. The proposed formulation is proven to reproduce the prescribed velocity correlation with energy spectrum at large Reynolds numbers. Four test cases are considered to evaluate the new method. First, the statistical quantities introduced in the proposed method are verified numerically in a classical homogeneous turbulence case. Then, the performance of the new method is demonstrated in three different inhomogeneous turbulence cases: a confined turbulent flow in a "slip-wall" box, a planar channel flow and an annular flow. It is shown that the unphysical patterns in the fluctuation fields and divergence errors produced with Smirnov?s method are absent in the results from the new method. The accuracy of the proposed methods is verified by comparing the velocity correlations with the prescribed scaling functions. The proposed method is efficient and simple to implement. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We investigate the entrainment, deposition and motion of coarse spherical particles within a turbulent shallow water stream down a steep slope. This is an idealization of bed-load transport in mountain streams. Earlier investigations have described this kind of sediment transport using empirical correlations or concepts borrowed from continuum mechanics. The intermittent character of particle transport at low-water discharges led us to consider it as a random process. Sediment transport in this regime results from the imbalance between entrainment and deposition of particles rather than from momentum balance between water and particles. We develop a birthemigration Markov process to describe the particle exchanges between the bed and the water stream. A key feature of the model is its long autocorrelation times and wide, frequent fluctuations in the solid discharge, a phenomenon never previously explained despite its ubiquity in both nature and laboratory experiments. We present experimental data obtained using a nearly two-dimensional channel and glass beads as a substitute for sediment. Entrainment, trajectories, and deposition were monitored using a high-speed digital camera. The empirical probability distributions of the solid discharge and deposition frequency were properly described by the theoretical model. Experiments confirmed the existence of wide and frequent fluctuations of the solid discharge, and revealed the existence of long autocorrelation time, but theory overestimates the autocorrelation times by a factor of around three. Particle velocity was weakly dependent on the fluid velocity contrary to the predictions of the theoretical model, which performs well when a single particle is moving. For our experiments, the dependence of the solid discharge on the fluid velocity is entirely controlled by the number of moving particles rather than by their velocity. We also noted significant changes in the behaviour of particle transport when the bed slope or the water discharge was increased. The more vigorous the stream was, the more continuous the solid discharge became. Moreover, although 90{\%} of the energy supplied by gravity to the stream is dissipated by turbulence for slopes lower than 10{\%}, particles dissipate more and more energy when the bed slope is increased, but surprisingly, the dissipation rate is nearly independent of fluid velocity.

To investigate the impact and functionality of the ECF, a three- dimensional (3D) hydraulic model was adopted in this study. The model was verified against vertical velocity profiles measured with an acoustic doppler current profiler in the study region. Results of the verification reveal that under the driving force of wind, the best agreement between simulated and measured currents occurs in the surface layer. Considering the complex nature of the hydraulic conditions in the harbour, the model performs reasonably well. Overall, the model should provide a useful tool considering and comparing hydraulic con- ditions under different ECF configurations and the existing condition. The functionality of a newly created connection channel used for the purpose of improving local water quality was studied in detail with some unexpected discoveries.},

abstract = {This paper describes the relationship between the statistics of bed load transport flux and the timescale over which it is sampled. A stochastic formulation is developed for the probability distribution function of bed load transport flux, based on the Ancey et al. (2008) theory. An analytical solution for the variance of bed load transport flux over differing sampling timescales is presented. The solution demonstrates that the timescale dependence of the variance of bed load transport flux reduces to a three-regime relation demarcated by an intermittency timescale (tI) and a memory timescale (tc). As the sampling timescale increases, this variance passes through an intermittent stage (≪tI), an invariant stage (tI {\textless} t {\textless} tc), and a memoryless stage (≫ tc). We propose a dimensionless number (Ra) to represent the relative strength of fluctuation, which provides a common ground for comparison of fluctuation strength among different experiments, as well as different sampling timescales for each experiment. Our analysis indicates that correlated motion and the discrete nature of bed load particles are responsible for this three-regime behavior. We use the data from three experiments with high temporal resolution of bed load transport flux to validate the proposed three-regime behavior. The theoretical solution for the variance agrees well with all three sets of experimental data. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the observed fluctuations of bed load transport flux over monosize/multiple-size grain beds, to the characterization of an inherent connection between short-term measurements and long-term statistics, and to the design of appropriate sampling strategies for bed load transport flux.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a generalized Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) (gLoG) filter for detecting general elliptical blob structures in images. The gLoG filter can not only accurately locate the blob centers but also estimate the scales, shapes, and orientations of the detected blobs. These functions can be realized by generalizing the common 3-D LoG scale-space blob detector to a 5-D gLoG scale-space one, where the five parameters are image-domain coordinates (x, y), scales ($\sigma$(x), $\sigma$(y)), and orientation ($\theta$), respectively. Instead of searching the local extrema of the image's 5-D gLoG scale space for locating blobs, a more feasible solution is given by locating the local maxima of an intermediate map, which is obtained by aggregating the log-scale-normalized convolution responses of each individual gLoG filter. The proposed gLoG-based blob detector is applied to both biomedical images and natural ones such as general road-scene images. For the biomedical applications on pathological and fluorescent microscopic images, the gLoG blob detector can accurately detect the centers and estimate the sizes and orientations of cell nuclei. These centers are utilized as markers for a watershed-based touching-cell splitting method to split touching nuclei and counting cells in segmentation-free images. For the application on road images, the proposed detector can produce promising estimation of texture orientations, achieving an accurate texture-based road vanishing point detection method. The implementation of our method is quite straightforward due to a very small number of tunable parameters.},

abstract = {Bedload and river morphology interact in a strong feedback manner. Bedload conditions the development of river morphology along different space and time scales; however, by concentrating the flow in preferential paths, a given morphology controls bedload for a given discharge. As bedload is a non-linear response of shear stress, local morphology is likely to have a strong impact on bedload prediction when the shear stress is averaged over the section, as is usually done. This was investigated by comparing bedloadmeasured in different bedmorphologies (step-pool, plane bed, riffle-pool, braiding, and sand beds), with bedloadmeasured in narrowflumes in the absence of any bed form, used here as a reference. The initialmethodology consisted of fitting a bedload equation to the flume data. Secondly, themorphological signature of each river was studied as the distance to this referent equation. It was concluded that each morphology affects bedload in a different way. For a given average grain shear stress, the larger the river, the larger the deviation fromthe flume transport. Narrow streams are thosemorphologies that behave more like flumes; this is particularly true with flat beds, whereas results deviate from flumes to a greater extent in step-pools. The riffle-pool's morphology impacts bedload at different levels depending on the degree of bar development, considered here through the ratio D84/D50 which is used as a proxy for the local bed patchiness and morphology. In braiding riversmorphological effects are important but difficult to assess because width is dependent on transport rate. Bedmorphologywas found to have negligible effects in sand bed rivers where the Shields stress is usually sufficiently high to minimize the non-linearity effects when hydraulics is averaged over the section.},

abstract = {The presence of sediment cover in bedrock rivers inhibits saltation-driven incision, and so accurate predictions of the relationship between bedrock exposure (Fe) and relative sediment flux (sediment supply rate over capacity sediment transport rate, Qs/Qt) are necessary to model incision and hence landscape evolution. Theoretical predictions of a linear or negative exponential form for this relationship are not consistent with laboratory data that instead demonstrate a range of different relationships. Here we use a cellular automaton (CA) model to establish how the relationship between Fe and Qs/Qt evolves from the dynamics of, and interactions between, individual sediment grains moving through a bedrock channel. The key model parameter is the probability of grain entrainment, which is altered as a function of the number of neighboring grains in order to reproduce the enhanced mobility of isolated grains on bedrock surfaces. For each model run, an equilibrium sediment cover is attained for a specified sediment input, enabling the relationship between Fe and Qs/Qt to be established. As well as both linear and exponential relationships, model runs reproduce other relationships observed in laboratory experiments. These other relationships require isolated grains to be more easily entrained than grains in sediment clusters, which is consistent with field observations of grain mobility. There is therefore a continuum of relationships between Fe and Qs/Qt; the relationship that is most applicable to a particular reach will depend on the role of channel slope, roughness and shear stress in controlling the entrainment of grains from bedrock and alluvial surfaces.},

abstract = {The sculpture of valleys by flowing water is widely recognized, and$\backslash$nsimplified models of incision by this process (e.g., the stream power$\backslash$nlaw) are the basis for most recent landscape evolution models. Under$\backslash$nsteady state conditions a stream power law predicts that channel$\backslash$nslope varies as an inverse power law of drainage area. Using both$\backslash$ncontour maps and laser altimetry, we find that this inverse power$\backslash$nlaw rarely extends to slopes greater than $\backslash${\~{}}0.03 to 0.10, values$\backslash$nbelow which debris flows rarely travel. Instead, with decreasing$\backslash$ndrainage area the rate of increase in slope declines, leading to$\backslash$na curved relationship on a log-log plot of slope against drainage$\backslash$narea. Fieldwork in the western United States and Taiwan indicates$\backslash$nthat debris flow incision of bedrock valley floors tends to terminate$\backslash$nupstream of where strath terraces begin and where area-slope data$\backslash$nfollow fluvial power laws. These observations lead us to propose$\backslash$nthat the steeper portions of unglaciated valley networks of landscapes$\backslash$nsteep enough to produce mass failures are predominately cut by debris$\backslash$nflows, whose topographic signature is an area-slope plot that curves$\backslash$nin log-log space. This matters greatly as valleys with curved area-slope$\backslash$nplots are both extensive by length ({\textgreater}80{\%} of large steepland basins)$\backslash$nand comprise large fractions of main stem valley relief (25�100{\%}).$\backslash$nAs a consequence, valleys carved by debris flows, not rivers, bound$\backslash$nmost hillslopes in unglaciated steeplands. Debris flow scour of these$\backslash$nvalleys appears to limit the height of some mountains to substantially$\backslash$nlower elevations than river incision laws would predict, an effect$\backslash$nabsent in current landscape evolution models. We anticipate that$\backslash$nan understanding of debris flow incision, for which we currently$\backslash$nlack even an empirical expression, would substantially change model$\backslash$nresults and inferences drawn about linkages between landscape morphology$\backslash$nand tectonics, climate, and geology.},

abstract = {Existing numerical river models are mostly built upon asynchronous solution of simplified governing equations. The strong coupling between water flow, sediment transport, and morphological evolution is thus ignored to a certain extent. An earlier study led to the development of a fully coupled model and identified the impacts of simplifications in the water-sediment mixture and global bed material continuity equations as well as of the asynchronous solution procedure for aggradation processes. This paper presents the results of an extended study along this line, highlighting the impacts on both aggradation and degradation processes. Simplifications in the continuity equations for the water-sediment mixture and bed material are found to have negligible effects on degradation. This is, however, in contrast to aggradation processes, in which the errors purely due to simplified continuity equations can be significant transiently. The asynchronous solution procedure is found to entail appreciable inaccuracy for both aggradation and degradation processes. Further, the asynchronous solution procedure can render the physical problem mathematically ill posed by invoking an extra upstream boundary condition in the supercritical flow regime. Finally, the impacts of simplified continuity equations and an asynchronous solution procedure are shown to be comparable with those of largely tuned friction factors, indicating their significance in calibrating numerical river models. It is concluded that the coupled system of complete governing equations needs to be synchronously solved for refined modeling of alluvial rivers.},

abstract = {In this paper, the results of an experimental investigation of the turbulence intensity in gravel bed channels are described. The runs were carried out by measuring, with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter, the turbulence intensity profile along six verticals of a given cross section in a laboratory flume. The analysis of the measured intensity distributions has shown the existence of two different regions, above and below the tops of the roughness elements, in which different intensity profiles occur. Furthermore, the measured profiles have shown a maximum of the turbulence intensity that decreases for increasing values of the roughness height, confirming that the turbulence damping efficiency increases when the roughness elements protrude inside the flow. The applicability of Nezu's relationship ?derived for a hydraulically smooth bed? for the experimental intensity profiles above the roughness elements is positively tested. Finally a new intensity distribution for a rough bed, applicable to the whole water depth, is proposed. In this profile, two coefficients having a known physical meaning ?the maximum turbulence intensity and the depth at which this maximum is located? appear.},

abstract = {In soil-mantled steeplands, soil motions associated with creep, ravel, rain splash, soil slips, tree throw, and rodent activity are patchy and intermittent and involve widely varying travel distances. To describe the collective effect of these motions, we formulate a nonlocal expression for the soil flux. This probabilistic formulation involves upslope and downslope convolutions of land surface geometry to characterize motions in both directions, notably accommodating the bidirectional dispersal of material on gentle slopes as well as mostly downslope dispersal on steeper slopes, and it distinguishes between the mobilization of soil material and the effect of surface slope in giving a downslope bias to the dispersal of mobilized material. The formulation separates dispersal associated with intermittent surface motions from the slower bulk behavior associated with small-scale bioturbation and similar dilational processes operating mostly within the soil column. With a uniform rate of mobilization of soil material, the nearly parabolic form of a hillslope profile at steady state resembles a diffusive behavior. With a slope-dependent rate of mobilization, the steady state hillslope profile takes on a nonparabolic form where land surface elevation varies with downslope distance x as x(a) with a similar to 3/2, consistent with field observations and where the flux increases nonlinearly with increasing slope. The convolution description of the soil flux, when substituted into a suitable expression of conservation, yields a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation and can be mapped to discrete particle models of hillslope behavior and descriptions of soil-grain transport by rain splash as a stochastic advection-dispersion process.},

@article{Ferdowsi2016,
abstract = {Gravel-river beds typically have an "armored" layer of coarse grains on the surface, which acts to protect finer particles underneath from erosion. River bed-load transport is a kind of dense granular flow, and such flows are known to vertically segregate grains. The contribution of granular physics to river-bed armoring, however, has not been investigated. Here we examine these connections in a laboratory river with bimodal sediment size, by tracking the motion of particles from the surface to deep inside the bed, and find that armor develops by two distinct mechanisms. Bed-load transport in the near-surface layer drives rapid segregation, with a vertical advection rate proportional to the granular shear rate. Creeping grains beneath the bed-load layer give rise to slow but persistent segregation, which is diffusion dominated and insensitive to shear rate. We verify these findings with a continuum phenomenological model and discrete element method simulations. Our results suggest that river beds armor by granular segregation from below --- rather than fluid-driven sorting from above --- while also providing new insights on the mechanics of segregation that are relevant to a wide range of granular flows.},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the role of turbulence fluctuations on the entrainment of a fully exposed grain near threshold flow conditions. Experiments were carried out to measure synchronously the near bed flow velocity and the particle movement for a range of flow conditions and resulting particle entrainment frequencies. We used a simplified bed geometry consisted of spherical particles to reduce the complexities associated with the variations in the bed and flow details in an effort to identify the underlying dominant physical mechanism. An analysis was performed based on common force approximations using near bed flow velocity. Turbulence fluctuations were treated as impulses, which are products of magnitude and duration of applied force. It is demonstrated that besides the magnitude of the instantaneous forces applied on a sediment grain, their duration is important as well in determining whether a particle will be entrained by a turbulent flow event. Frequency of particle entrainment varied remarkably with minute changes in gross flow parameters. Impulse imparted on the sediment grain by turbulent flow was found to be well represented by a log-normal distribution. We obtained a (log-normal) probability density function (pdf) dependent on only the coefficient of variation of the impulse (impulse intensity). Relation of the impulse intensity to the particle Reynolds number, Re∗, was established. The sensitivity of the computed impulse to the critical force level, as well as the influence of the critical impulse level on the dislodgement events, was explored. Particle entrainment probabilities were found using the derived pdf as well as experimental observations and a good agreement between the two is reported. Implications of the presented impulse concept and our experimental findings for sediment mobility at low bed shear stress conditions are also discussed.},

abstract = {We investigate the stability of steppool channels by examining how the traditional approach to bed stability based on the critical Shields number is modified by particles jamming across the width of the channel. Experiments were conducted in a flume with slopes ranging between 3{\%} and 18{\%} and either smooth or rough walls. By varying the size of sediment and width of the flume we observed that the stability of the bed increases as the jamming ratio (channel width/D84step is the diameter at which 84{\%} of the step stones are smaller) decreases for jamming ratios less than six. At low jamming ratios both grain ongrain structuring and sediment entrainment phenomena affect the stability of the bed. Actual bed failure, however, depends upon the history of bed development and the chance arrangement of the stone structures in the bed. Thus, the experiments also demonstrate that the inherently stochastic nature of sediment transport affects not only the movement of individual grains but also the stability of the channel as a whole. Since stochastic processes affect the stability of the entire channel, there is no clearly defined separation between stable and unstable beds, rather, an overlapping field where both stable and unstable bed states can exist. This field was modeled using logistic regression to derive a probability of bed failure. A comparison of data from experiments with rough banks and smooth banks showed that rough banks significantly increase the stability of the bed.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A new particle-based reduced-complexity model to simulate sediment transport and channel morphology in steep streams in presented. The model CAST (Cellular Automaton Sediment Transport) contains phenomenological parameterizations, deterministic or stochastic, of sediment supply, bed load transport, and particle entrainment and deposition in a cellular-automaton space with uniform grain size. The model reproduces a realistic bed morphology and typical fluctuations in transport rates observed in steep channels. Particle hop distances, from entrainment to deposition, are well fitted by exponential distributions, in agreement with field data. The effect of stochasticity in both the entrainment and the input rate is shown. A stochastic parameterization of the entrainment is essential to create and maintain a realistic channel morphology, while the intermittent transport of grains in CAST shreds the input signal and its stochastic variability. A jamming routine has been added to CAST to simulate the grain–grain and grain–bed interactions that lead to particle jamming and step formation in a step-pool stream. The results show that jamming is effective in generating steps in unsteady conditions. Steps are created during high-flow periods and they survive during low flows only in sediment-starved conditions, in agreement with the jammed-state hypothesis of Church and Zimmermann (2007). Reduced-complexity models like CAST give new insights into the dynamics of complex phenomena such as sediment transport and bedform stability and are a useful complement to fully physically based models to test research hypotheses.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

These impacts can vary greatly depending on the hydro- geomorphic setting of the river, and on the change in water and sediment supply to the reach downstream. Results drawn from field studies of gravel-bed reaches of the Colorado River in Colorado and Trinity River in California illustrate the range of issues to consider in assessing the effects of flow regime and sediment transport on micro- and meso-scale habitats. Important aspects of bed-load trans- port at the local scale are discussed, along with ecological implications of spe- cific transport phases and processes. For a wide range of rivers, including those that carry predominantly fine sediment (silt and sand), the loss of channel com- plexity and habitat heterogeneity represents a broader issue. We suggest that unless the broader-scale importance of sediment input and output is recognized and quantified, restoration efforts that focus on site-specific issues or single- species enhancement are likely to fall short of their objectives.},

abstract = {The performance is tested of 12 bed load sediment transport formulae developed for use in gravel bed channels. The formulae are applied in the manner intended by the original authors. To this end, the test data are restricted to ones obtained in approximately steady flow when the material in motion was similar to that present on the bed; that is, transport was not size selective. This represents the nearest approach to “equilibrium sediment transport” that can be realized with available data. Four sets of river data and three sets of flume data were chosen for the test, covering a range of eight orders of magnitude in unit bed load transport rate. The test data were not used in the development of the formulae. The analysis separates mean bias and local bias. No formula performs consistently well. Limitations of the test data, the constraints imposed by an operationally realistic test, and reasons based upon the physics of the transport phenomenon all may be adduced for this. To estimate the magnitude of transport with limited hydraulic information, stream power equations should be used because they provide the most straightforward scale correlation of the phenomenon. In particular, the approach of Bagnold deserves further study. When local hydraulic information is available, a formula should be selected that is sensitive to bed state or grain size distribution and, in this context, the formulae of Einstein, Parker, and Ackers-White-Day bear continued examination.},

The Shields diagram is famous due to its application in ascertaining the threshold of sediment motion that is an essential prerequisite for the estimation of sediment transport in an alluvial stream. Since his pioneering work, numerous attempts have so far been made to study the sediment threshold both experimentally and theoretically. This paper presents a comprehensive state-of-the-art review of the important laboratory experimental and theoretical investigations on sediment threshold under steady stream flow highlighting the empirical concepts, hydrodynamic background and the mathematical treatment of the problem.

abstract = {The laboratory experiments on sediment transport conducted by G. K. Gilbert differed importantly in technique from such studies of more recent date. Gilbert's flume was level and could not be altered in slope. Sediment was introduced at the upper end at a predetermined rate and by deposition built a bed gradient sufficient to transport the introduced load. The adjustment of slope in Gilbert's flume has contributed to the idea widely held by geologists that a river achieves equilibrium by adjustingits slope to provide just the velocity required for the transportation of the supplied load. In fact, slope adjusts but little to a change in amount of introduced sediment load. The adjustment takes place principally among other hydraulic factors: width, depth, velocity, bed forms, channel pattern, and pool-riffle sequence. Gilbert sensed this complicated adjustment process, but its details are as yet only partially known in quantitative terms.},

abstract = {[1] Previous work highlights the need for data collection to identify appropriate models for temporal evolution of tracer dispersal in rivers. Results of 64 gravel-bed field tracer experiments covering a wide range of flow and sediment supply regimes are compiled here to determine the probabilistic character of gravel transport. We focus on whether particle travel distances and waits are thin-or heavy-tailed. While heavy-tailed travel distance distributions are observed between successive monitoring events in different hydrological and sediment supply regimes, heavy-tailedness does not persist through total travel distance over multiple monitoring events, suggesting that individual monitoring events occur before particle travel distance exceeds the characteristic correlation length for the channel (such that particles that start in fast paths remain in fast paths and particles in slow paths remain in slow paths). After a large number of transport events, super-diffusive spreading was not observed at any of the gravel bed streams. Continuous-time tracking of x, y, z coordinates of tracers in natural streams is necessary to capture exact step and waiting time distributions.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional simulation model of travel distances of individual particles in a gravel-bed river is presented. The model is based on a number of rules, which include particle size, entrainment, trajectory, distance of movement and entrapment. Particle interactions are controlled by resistance fields defined about each obstacle and critical elevation defined in the model. Resistance fields, particle dropping and critical elevation rules control particle interactions. The interaction rules cause the particles to develop pebble clusters, stone cells and transverse structures (transverse ribs). The simulated travel distances of individual particles are consistent with reported field results. Individual particle travel distances were simulated using two different models; one without interactions between the individual particles and the stationary bed and one with interactions. The case without interactions demonstrates the random nature of sediment transport, and narrow ranges of travel distances. Wider ranges of travel distances, similar to those for natural situations, were obtained for the cases with interactions. The more intense the interaction between the mobile stones and the stationary ones, the wider the range of distances of travel for a given particle size. Modelling the mean travel distance yielded a result similar to that published previously, which was based on empirical data. Well developed bed-surface structures were obtained for relatively poorly sorted sediment with intense interactions between particles. Transverse structures developed when relatively large particles were allowed to move.},

abstract = {The physical component of river channel (instream) habitat is of acknowledged significance, particularly in headwater streams; furthermore, physical habitats have been heavily impacted by human needs for river services: principally flood defence (channel modification) and water resources (flow regulation). Despite the control exercised on physical habitats by fluvial geomorphology (channel shape, bed material size, bedforms and bars) and flow regime (including the varying hydraulics of flow around these forms), their interaction has hitherto lacked a distinctive spatial formulation and biological validation.This article describes the challenges faced by a need (in both theoretical and practical areas) to understand the detail of physical habitat conditions in stream channels. A number of mesoscale approaches are emerging, both from ecology and geomorphology. We outline the field validation of a ‘habitat hydraulics' approach to the interaction between river discharge and channel form. Qualitative ‘flow types' are shown to be representative of discrete hydraulic conditions within mesoscale units of the channel bed described as ‘physical biotopes'. The approach is compared with parallel ecological research on ‘mesohabitats' and ‘functional habitats'. The extent, pattern and discharge-variability of physical biotopes can be surveyed in the field and used as a spatial guide to biological sampling (in this case for benthic invertebrates). Biological patterns (at the scale sampled here) appear to respond first to the river continuum concept's longitudinal zonation of the channel, but there is a marked secondary signal in statistical analyses from the pattern of biotopes.Given the promise of the physical biotope approach, its logical extension in predictive mode is via the hierarchical concepts shared by freshwater ecologists and geomorphologists; however, there is little agreement on scale terminology, hierarchical principles and, above all, a truly geo-morphological channel classification, based on reaches, into which mesoscale habitat typologies could be fed. Assuming a relationship between biological diversity and that of physical biotopes it should be the aim of river managers, whether intervening in the channel form or its flow regime, to optimize certain parameters of the pattern of biotopes; these parameters should be a focus for future research. Both the rapid survey and proper description of these patterns will benefit from the application of remote-sensing technology, improved instruments for microscale hydraulic studies and a GIS approach based upon the spatial principles of landscape ecology.},

The log-law for the velocity is preserved above the interfacial sublayer, while the velocity within that sublayer follows a polynomial law. The Reynolds shear stress distribution within the roughness sublayer has a considerable damping. A quadrant analysis suggests that the sweeps become the prevalent mechanism within the interfacial sublayer. Within the interfacial sublayer, the quadrant plots of the form-induced velocities form a tilted pseudo-elliptical shape, suggesting that the fluid undergoes a cyclic process of upward-streamwise deceleration and downward-streamwise acceleration. An upward-downstream flux of the turbulent kinetic energy is prevalent over the entire flow depth, while a downward-upstream flux corresponding to sweep events is the mechanism within the interfacial sublayer. The energy budget indicates that the turbulent production, dissipation and diffusion, having attained their peaks, reduce sharply within the interfacial sublayer, and the pressure energy diffusion changes drastically to a negative magnitude below the virtual bed level.},

Bedload and typical bed material (subpavement) size distributions are observed to be similar; it follows that the coarse half of the subpavement moves through a reach at a rate near that of the fine half. Since coarser grains are intrinsically less mobile than fine grains, it follows that some mechanism must act to nearly equalize mobility. It is hypothesized that the pavement seen in gravel bed streams at low flow is in fact in place during typical transport events capable of moving all available sizes. This pavement can provide the equalizing mechanism by exposing proportionally more coarse grains to the flow. Field data are used to quantify this concept and to develop a predictive relation for river pavement. The model indicates that pavement should be absent in most sand bed streams, in agreement with observation.},

abstract = {The occurrence of sufficiently energetic flow events characterized by impulses of varying magnitude is treated as a point process. It is hypothesized that the rare but extreme magnitude impulses are responsible for the removal of coarse grains from the bed matrix. This conjecture is investigated utilizing distributions from extreme value theory and a series of incipient motion experiments. The application of extreme value distributions is demonstrated for both the entire sets of impulses and the maxima above a sufficiently high impulse quantile. In particular, the Frechet distribution is associated with a power law relationship between the frequency of occurrence and magnitude of impulses. It provides a good fit to the flow impulses, having comparable performance to other distributions. Next, a more accurate modeling of the tail of the distribution of impulses is pursued, consistent with the observation that the majority of impulses above a critical value are directly linked to grain entrainments. The peaks over threshold method is implemented to extract conditional impulses in excess of a sufficiently high impulse level. The generalized Pareto distribution is fitted to the excess impulses, and parameters are estimated for various impulse thresholds and methods of estimation for all the experimental runs. Finally, the episodic character of individual grain mobilization is viewed as a survival process, interlinked to the extremal character of occurrence of impulses. The interarrival time of particle entrainment events is successfully modeled by the Weibull and exponential distributions, which belong to the family of extreme value distributions.},

Although this guidance is widely cited, only water supply is routinely incorporated in a consistent manner in restoration design. A number of factors can alter both the caliber and rate of sediment supply to a stream. Exact forecasts of sediment supply are seldom available and it is often possible to reliably estimate only the sign of changes in sediment supply. Channel design methodology, including estimates of sediment transport, must account for large uncertainty in future sediment supply. This paper examines sediment transport in coarse-bedded streams with the goal of identifying robust methods that provide reliable estimates of present and future transport. The response of bed composition and elevation to changes in sediment supply rate and caliber is examined. The accuracy and cost of methods for estimating sediment flux are evaluated.

abstract = {Gravel-bed river floodplains in mountain landscapes disproportionately concentrate diverse habitats, nutrient cycling, productivity of biota, and species interactions. Although stream ecologists know that river channel and floodplain habitats used by aquatic organisms are maintained by hydrologic regimes that mobilize gravel-bed sediments, terrestrial ecologists have largely been unaware of the importance of floodplain structures and processes to the life requirements of a wide variety of species. We provide insight into gravel-bed rivers as the ecological nexus of glaciated mountain landscapes. We show why gravel-bed river floodplains are the primary arena where interactions take place among aquatic, avian, and terrestrial species from microbes to grizzly bears and provide essential connectivity as corridors for movement for both aquatic and terrestrial species. Paradoxically, gravel-bed river floodplains are also disproportionately unprotected where human developments are concentrated. Structural modifications to floodplains such as roads, railways, and housing and hydrologic-altering hydroelectric or water storage dams have severe impacts to floodplain habitat diversity and productivity, restrict local and regional connectivity, and reduce the resilience of both aquatic and terrestrial species, including adaptation to climate change. To be effective, conservation efforts in glaciated mountain landscapes intended to benefit the widest variety of organisms need a paradigm shift that has gravel-bed rivers and their floodplains as the central focus and that prioritizes the maintenance or restoration of the intact structure and processes of these critically important systems throughout their length and breadth.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015, The Author(s).The motion of bedload particles is diffusive and occurs within at least three scale ranges: local, intermediate and global, each of which with a distinctly different diffusion regime. However, these regimes, extensions of the scale ranges and boundaries between them remain to be better defined and quantified. These issues are explored using a Lagrangian model of saltating grains over the uniform fixed bed. The model combines deterministic particle motion dynamics with stochastic characteristics such as probability distributions of step lengths and resting times. Specifically, it is proposed that a memoryless exponential distribution is an appropriate model for the distribution of rest periods while the probability that a particle stops after a current jump follows a binomial distribution, which is a distribution with lack of memory as well. These distributions are incorporated in the deterministic Lagrangian model of saltating grains and extensive numerical simulations are conducted for the identification of the diffusive behavior of particles at different time scales. Based on the simulations and physical considerations, the local, intermediate, and global scale ranges are quantified and the transitions from one range to another are studied for a spectrum of motion parameters. The obtained results demonstrate that two different time scales should be considered for parameterization of diffusive behavior within intermediate and global scale ranges and for defining the local–intermediate and intermediate–global boundaries. The simulations highlight the importance of the distributions of the step lengths and resting times for the identification of the boundaries (or transition intervals) between the scale ranges.},

abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed the development and application of well-balanced numerical models for shallow flows in natural rivers. However, until now there have been no such models for flows with non-uniform sediment transport. This paper presents a 1D well-balanced model to simulate flows and non-capacity transport of non-uniform sediment in alluvial rivers. The active layer formulation is adopted to resolve the change of bed sediment composition. In the framework of the finite volume Slope LImiter Centred (SLIC) scheme, a surface gradient method is incorporated to attain well-balanced solutions to the governing equations. The proposed model is tested against typical cases with irregular topography, including the refilling of dredged trenches, aggradation due to sediment overloading and flood flow due to landslide dam failure. The agreement between the computed results and measured data is encouraging. Compared to a non-well-balanced model, the well-balanced model features improved performance in reproducing stage, velocity and bed deformation. It should find general applications for non-uniform sediment transport modelling in alluvial rivers, especially in mountain areas where the bed topography is mostly irregular.},

It differs from the common operator calculus of the quantum theory in the fact that the wave function is defined in a finite space (the atomic polyhedron) bounded by a finite surface.

abstract = {This paper reviews sediment transport and channel morphology in small, forested streams in the Pacific Northwest region of North America to assess current knowledge of channel stability and morphology relevant to riparian management prac- tices around small streams. Small channels are defined as ones in which morphology and hydraulics may be significantly influenced by individual clasts or wood materials in the channel. Such chan- nels are headwater channels in close proximity to sediment sources, so they reflect a mix of hillslope and channel processes. Sediment inputs are derived directly from adjacent hillslopes and from the channel banks. Morphologically significant sediments move mainly as bed load, mainly at low intensity, and there is no standard method for measurement. The larger clastic and woody elements in the channel form persistent structures that trap significant vol- umes of sediment, reducing sediment transport in the short term and substantially increasing channel stability. The presence of such structures makes modeling of sediment flux in these channels – a potential substitute for measurement – difficult. Channel morphol- ogy is discussed, with some emphasis on wood related features. The problem of classifying small channels is reviewed, and it is recog- nized that useful classifications are purpose oriented. Reach scale and channel unit scale morphologies are categorized. A “distur- bance cascade” is introduced to focus attention on sediment trans- fers through the slope channel system and to identify management practices that affect sediment dynamics and consequent channel morphology. Gaps in knowledge, errors, and uncertainties have been identified for future research.},

However, a naive extension of the threshold theory of canals in coarse alluvium to straight reaches of gravel rivers leads to the stable-channel paradox: transport of bed material is incompatible with a stable width. In this paper singular perturbation techniques are used to obtain a bed stress distribution which allows a mobile bed but immobile banks at bankfull or dominant discharge. This result is used to obtain regime relations for straight rivers with bed and banks composed of coarse gravel. The analysis, although dependent on a series of approximate assumptions for Reynolds-stress closure and sediment transport, provides reasonable agreement with data.},

abstract = {This article examines the spatial dynamics of bed load particles in water. We focus particularly on the fluctuations of particle activity, which is defined as the number of moving particles per unit bed length. Based on a stochastic model recently proposed by Ancey and Heyman (2014), we derive the second moment of particle activity analytically, that is, the spatial correlation functions of particle activity. From these expressions, we show that large moving particle clusters can develop spatially. Also, we provide evidence that fluctuations of particle activity are scale dependent. Two characteristic lengths emerge from the model: a saturation length ..sat describing the length needed for a perturbation in particle activity to relax to the homogeneous solution and a correlation length ..c describing the typical size of moving particle clusters. A dimensionless Peclet number can also be defined according to the transport model. Three different experimental data sets are used to test the theoretical results. We show that the stochastic model describes spatial patterns of particle activity well at all scales. In particular, we show that ..c and ..sat may be relatively large compared to typical scales encountered in bed load experiments (grain diameter, water depth, bed form wavelength, flume length, etc.) suggesting that the spatial fluctuations of particle activity have a nonnegligible impact on the average transport process.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous materials abound in nature and man-made situations. Examples include porous media, biological materials, and composite materials. Diverse and interesting properties exhibited by these materials result from their complex microstructures, which also make it difficult to model the materials. Yeong and Torquato [Phys. Rev. E 57, 495 (1998)] introduced a stochastic optimization technique that enables one to generate realizations of heterogeneous materials from a prescribed set of correlation functions. In this first part of a series of two papers, we collect the known necessary conditions on the standard two-point correlation function S2(r) and formulate a conjecture. In particular, we argue that given a complete two-point correlation function space, S2(r) of any statistically homogeneous material can be expressed through a map on a selected set of bases of the function space. We provide examples of realizable two-point correlation functions and suggest a set of analytical basis functions. We also discuss an exact mathematical formulation of the (re)construction problem and prove that S2(r) cannot completely specify a two-phase heterogeneous material alone. Moreover, we devise an efficient and isotropy-preserving construction algorithm, namely, the lattice-point algorithm to generate realizations of materials from their two-point correlation functions based on the Yeong-Torquato technique. Subsequent analysis can be performed on the generated images to obtain desired macroscopic properties. These developments are integrated here into a general scheme that enables one to model and categorize heterogeneous materials via two-point correlation functions. We will mainly focus on basic principles in this paper. The algorithmic details and applications of the general scheme are given in the second part of this series of two papers.},

The locations of effective drag and lift forces are explored, as well as the ratio of drag and lift coefficients. The comparison between rollover and pickup probability models indicates that pickup model is valid for cases of critical shear stress less than 0.1 while rollover model works for critical shear stress larger than 0.1.

abstract = {A series of flume experiments were conducted to study the effect of bed form dynamics on the flow over a gravel bed comprising a wide distribution of grain sizes. Instantaneous high-frequency streamwise flow velocities were sampled using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter at a frequency of 200 Hz, while the simultaneous bed elevations were sampled using sonar transducers at a frequency of 0.2 Hz for a duration of 20 h. Spectral analysis of the measured velocity fluctuations reveals the existence of two distinct power law scaling regimes. At high frequencies, an inertial subrange of turbulence with {\&}{\#}8764;{\&}{\#}8722;5/3 Kolmogorov scaling is observed. At low frequencies, another scaling regime with spectral slope of about {\&}{\#}8722;1.1 is found. We interpret this range as the signature of the evolving multiscale bed topography on the near-bed velocity fluctuations. The two scaling ranges are separated by a spectral gap, i.e., a range of intermediate scales with no additional energy contribution. The high-frequency limit of the spectral gap corresponds to the integral scale of turbulence. The low-frequency end of the gap corresponds to the scale of the smallest bed forms identified by the velocity sensor, which depends on the position of the sensor. Our results also show that the temporal scales of the largest bed forms can be potentially identified from spectral analysis of low-resolution velocity measurements collected near the channel bed.},

Flight time and sticking time probability distribution functions (PDFs) have power law decays: P(t) similar to t(-mu) and t(-nu) for flights and sticking, respectively. We calculate the dependence of the variance exponent gamma (sigma(2) similar to t(gamma)) on the PDF exponents mu and nu. For a broad distribution of flight times (mu {\textless} 3), the motion is superdiffusive (1 {\textless} gamma {\textless} 2), and the PDF has a divergent second moment, i.e., it is a Levy distribution. For a broad distribution of sticking times (nu {\textless} 3), either superdiffusion or subdiffusion (gamma {\textless} 1) can occur, with qualitative differences between symmetric and asymmetric walks. For narrow PDFs (mu 3, nu {\textgreater} 3), normal diffusion (gamma = 1) is recovered. Predictions of the model are related to experimental observations of transport in a rotating annulus. The Eulerian velocity field is chaotic, yet it is still possible to distinguish between well-defined sticking events (particles trapped in vortices) and flights (particles making long excursions in a jet). The distribution of flight lengths is well described by a power law with a divergent second moment (Levy distribution). The observed transport is strongly asymmetric and is well described by the proposed model.},

abstract = {Although numerous guides exist for building theory, these do not provide much help in carefully gathering material from past research that can serve as material for new theory development. Moreover, although there are numerous guides for conducting literature reviews, none focuses squarely on theory development. We fill this dual shortage by identifying and describing theory-mining reviews, literature reviews that explicitly extract and synthesize the elements of theory from primary studies. Our citation analysis finds that such reviews in information systems have been more highly cited than other kinds of reviews, whether authored by senior or by junior scholars. We present detailed guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review (also known as a systematic review) that develops three different kinds of theory-mining reviews: scoping out a theoretical landscape, contending for a new theoretical model, or rigorously testing a proposed theory. These guidelines are particularly tailored for information systems research, but are sufficiently general to be readily applicable in a wide range of social sciences, so that researchers can stand on the shoulders of foregoing scholarly giants to see farther with new, insightful theories.},

abstract = {Travel distance and residence time probability distributions are the key components of stochastic models for coarse sediment transport. Residence time for individual grains is difficult to measure and residence time distributions appropriate to field and laboratory settings are typically inferred theoretically or from overall transport characteristics. However, bed elevation time series collected using sonar-transducers and LIDAR can be translated into empirical residence time distributions at each elevation in the bed and for the entire bed thickness. Sediment residence time at a given depth can be conceptualized as a stochastic return time process on a finite interval. Overall sediment residence time is an average of residence times at all depths weighted by the likelihood of deposition at each depth. Theory and experiment show that when tracers are seeded on the bed surface, power- law residence time will be observed until a timescale set by the bed thickness and bed fluctuation statistics. After this time, the long-time (global) residence time distribution will take exponential form. Crossover time is the time of transition from power-law to exponential behavior. The crossover time in flume studies can be on the order of seconds to minutes while that in rivers can be days to years.},

Understanding the performance and limitations of the PIV method under these conditions is critical for optimising experimental parameters and robust interpretation of data. The optimum algorithm for extracting velocity fields from PIV images is the subject of ongoing revision with the goal of maximising resolution and minimising errors, and recent advances in this regard may be particularly beneficial for open-channel turbulence research. Key steps in the iterative discrete shift (IDS) and image deformation method (IDM) algorithms are detailed, and the fundamental differences between direct cross correlation and FFT-based correlation methods are explained. It is also shown how the resolution of an algorithm can be determined from its modulation transfer function (MTF), and how the MTF can be manipulated with the selection of intensity weighting windows. The random error levels for selected algorithms are demonstrated under different image and flow field conditions, including the near boundary region, using simulated PIV images. ?? 2011 International Association of Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division.},

abstract = {Flow-competence assessments of floods have been based on the largest$\backslash$nparticle sizes transported, and yield either the mean flow stress,$\backslash$nmean velocity, or discharge per unit flow width. The use of extreme$\backslash$nparticle sizes has potential problems in that they may have been$\backslash$ntransported by debris flows rather than by the flood, it may be difficult$\backslash$nto locate the largest particles within the flood deposits, and there$\backslash$nare questions concerning how representative one or a few large particles$\backslash$nmight be of the transported sediments and therefore of the flood$\backslash$nhydraulics. Such problems would be eliminated for the most part if$\backslash$ncompetence evaluations are based on median grain sizes of transported$\backslash$nsediments, or perhaps on some coarse percentile that is established$\backslash$nby a reasonable number of grains. In order to examine such issues,$\backslash$nthe gravel-transport data of Milhous from Oak Creek, Oregon, and$\backslash$nof Carling from Great Eggleshope Beck, England, have been analysed$\backslash$nin terms of changing grain-size percentiles with varying flow stresses.$\backslash$nA comparison between these two data sets is of added interest because$\backslash$nthe bed material in Oak Creek is segregated into welldeveloped pavement$\backslash$nand subpavement layers, while such a layering of bed materials is$\backslash$nlargely absent in Great Eggleshope Beck.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe analyses show that the trend of increasing sizes of the largest$\backslash$nparticles in the bedload samples (diameter D,) with increasing flow$\backslash$nstresses is consistent with similar dependencies based on sieve percentiles$\backslash$nranging from the medians (D50) to the 95th percentiles (D,,). This$\backslash$nindicates that the largest particles are an integral part of the$\backslash$noverall distributions of bedload grain sizes, and respond to changing$\backslash$nflow hydraulics along with the rest of the size distribution. In$\backslash$nOak Creek, the median grain size shows the largest change with increasing$\backslash$nflow stresses, followed by Dso, and so on to D,, which shows the$\backslash$nsmallest change. The variations in D, continue this trend, and are$\backslash$nsimilar to those for D95. This systematic variation of grain-size$\backslash$npercentiles in Oak Creek is consistent with changes in the overall$\backslash$ndistributions which tend to be symmetrical and Gaussian for low discharges,$\backslash$nbut become skewed Rosin distributions for high discharges. In contrast,$\backslash$nin Great Eggleshope Beck the several percentiles and D, show the$\backslash$nsame rate of shift to coarser sizes as flow stresses increase. This$\backslash$nresults in part from differences in sampling techniques wherein the$\backslash$nbedload samples from Great Eggleshope Beck represent a complete flood$\backslash$nevent, while shorterterm samples at a specific flow stage were obtained$\backslash$nin Oak Creek. As a result of the integrated sampling in Great Eggleshope$\backslash$nBeck, the bedload grain-size distributions are more complex, commonly$\backslash$nwith a bimodal pattern. However, after accounting for differences$\backslash$nin sampling schemes in the two streams, contrasting patterns in changing$\backslash$ngrain-size distributions remain, and these are concluded to reflect$\backslash$ngrain sorting differences as the bedload grain-size distributions$\backslash$napproach the distributions of the bed materials. It is surprising$\backslash$nthat if criteria commonly employed to demonstrate the equal mobility$\backslash$nof different grain sizes are used in the comparison, then Great Eggleshope$\backslash$nBeck is far closer to this condition in spite of its minimal development$\backslash$nof a pavement. It is concluded that the respective shapes of the$\backslash$nbed-material grain-size distributions, in particular their degrees$\backslash$nof skewness, are more important to the observed sorting patterns$\backslash$nthan are the effects of a pavement layer regulating grain entrainment$\backslash$nto produce an equal mobility of different grain sizes. Therefore,$\backslash$nthe comparison has established that flow-competence relationships$\backslash$nwill differ from one stream to another, depending on the pattern$\backslash$nof grain sorting which is a function of the bedmaterial grain-size$\backslash$ndistribution.},

abstract = {The St Venant equations in conjunction with a phenomenological law for erosion are used to explore the nonlinear dynamics of cyclic steps – linearly unstable bedform patterns which emerge when uniform flow over an erodible bed becomes supercritical. The instability saturates by blocking the overlying flow and creating hydraulic jumps just downstream of the steepest part of the steps. Near onset, steadily migrating, nonlinear step patterns are constructed and shown to suffer a short-wavelength secondary instability that ‘roughens' the bed and renders the staircase patterns less regular and time-dependent. An eddy viscosity is needed to regularize both the onset of the primary steps and the secondary instabilities. Further beyond the critical Froude number, the steps block the flow sufficiently to arrest erosion significantly, creating complicated patterns mixing migrating steps and stationary bedforms. The reduction in flux also stabilizes roll waves – a second, hydrodynamic instability of uniform supercritical flow. It is further shown that roll waves are purely convective instabilities, whereas cyclic steps can be absolute. Thus, in the finite geometries of the laboratory or field, it may be difficult to excite roll waves. On the other hand, the complicated spatiotemporal patterns associated with the cyclic-step instability should develop naturally. The complicated patterns resulting from the secondary instability do not appear to have been observed experimentally, calling into question the validity of the model.},

abstract = {Drag on a bed sediment particle was measured using a force sensor in a laboratory flume. The applied flow velocity was also measured using particle image velocimetry. A quasi-steady spectral model is proposed to predict the spectra of drag force on the particle using point velocity data. The quantity CDA (where CD and A are the coefficient of drag and exposed area of the particle, respectively), which was determined experimentally, is used in the model owing to practical limitations in estimating appropriate values of the individual quantities (CD and A). The predicted spectrum is found to closely match the measured force spectrum up to 1 Hz, indicating the important role of low-frequency streamwise velocity fluctuations in generating quasi-steady drag force on the particle. The model highlights the significance of increased nonlinearity due to higher-order streamwise velocity fluctuations beyond 10 Hz. However, the nonlinearity due to shedding of vortices at higher frequencies is accounted for by coupling the model with an admittance function based on the exposure of the particle. The coupled model is found to perform satisfactorily for all exposures, except when the particle is flushed with the bed. The limitation of the quasi-steady model at lower exposures is also supported by poor correlation between the measured velocity and force time histories.},

abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of the origin and function of armouring in gravel-bed rivers have not addressed the role of non-uniformity and unsteadiness of flow. These flow attributes have important influences on both the surface and subsurface bed material size distributions which are observed at low flow, from which we commonly make inferences concerning bedload transport at high flow. Bed armouring, measured as the ratio of surface to subsurface bed material grain size, is highly variable spatially in a channel in which past and present bed aggradation indicates that the sediment supply has exceeded the transport capacity. Alternate bar topography induces strong variations in boundary shear stress, especially at low flow. The resulting winnowing of fine sediment from zones of high stress, such as riffles, and its deposition as thin sheets in zones of low stress, such as pools, produce wide variations in armouring. Linked winnowing and deposition of fine sediment in each bar pool sequence creates pronounced, local, streamwise sorting by grain size. Streamwise sorting can lead to pronounced apparent size-selectivity in bedload transport during subsequent rising stages. The relatively fine bedload transported during initial rising stages can originate from unarmoured deposits of fines, where all particle sizes present on the bed surface may be nearly equally mobile. These surfaces are devoid of larger particles, however, that appear in the bedload only when coarser armoured surfaces become more widely entrained. 13.1},

abstract = {Advances in computing technology, new and ongoing restoration initiatives, concerns about climate change's effects, and the increasing interdisciplinarity of research have encouraged the development of landscape-scale mechanistic models of coupled ecological-geophysical systems. However, communication barriers and uneven infiltration of new strategies for data-driven induction persist in the context of simulation model development across disciplines. One challenge is that ecology and the geosciences have embraced different modeling epistemologies, with ecologists historically favoring inductive inference from generalized, phenomenological models and geoscientists favoring deductive inference from detailed first-principles models. Today, many models used for environmental management, particularly for aquatic ecosystems, tend to be highly detailed, with ecological and geophysical components represented in different modules that are linked but often not closely integrated. These observations highlight a need for cross-disciplinary dialogue about landscape-scale modeling objectives and approaches. The philosophies of pattern-oriented modeling in ecology and exploratory modeling in geophysics have yielded advances in theoretical and applied knowledge in both of those disciplines, but they are not comprehensive across all aspects of landscape-scale modeling. Here we define and synthesize the “Appropriate-Complexity Method” (ACME), which builds upon these two philosophies to guide the development of process-oriented models across a spectrum of scientific and management objectives. ACME helps modelers efficiently converge upon an optimal modeling structure through: i) systematic evaluation of the attributes that comprise computational and representational detail, for which we have developed an operational decision tree; ii) iterative adjustment of models based on pattern-oriented model evaluation strategies; and iii) the use of appropriate datasets (where applicable) to build conceptual models and formulate predictions. Decisions about aspects of computational and representational detail are based on the landscape's emergent properties. They are also based on a hierarchy of classes of questions governing model objectives that represent a multi-attribute tradeoff among validation potential, interpretability, tractability, and generality as functions of computational and representational detail. Tradeoff curves, together with model objectives, provide further guidance for determining the “appropriate” level of complexity for representation of processes in models. Once deemed adequate for addressing the original research question of interest, models may be used for projection and scenario testing. They may next undergo expansion that moves them down the hierarchy, where they can then be used to address research questions of higher specificity, detail, and validation potential, though at a cost of lower tractability and interpretability on the tradeoff curves. This practical, systematic procedure provides clear guidance for the design and improvement of landscape models that may be used to address a wide variety of questions relevant to restoration, over a spectrum of scales.},

The differences between conventional 2D models and a proposed 3D saltation model are discussed and the advantages of the 3D model are highlighted. Particularly, the 3D model includes a special procedure allowing generation of 3D flow velocity fields. This procedure is based on the assumption that the spectra of streamwise, vertical and transverse velocity components are known at any distance from the bed. The 3D model was used to identify and quantify effects of turbulence on particle entrainment and saltation. The analysis of particle trajectories focused on their diffusive nature, clarifying: (i) the effect of particle mobility parameter; (ii) the effect of bed topography; and (iii) the effect of turbulence. Specifically, the results of numerical simulations describing the abovementioned effects on the change in time of the variance are presented. In addition, the change in time of the skewness and kurtosis, which are likely to reflect the turbulence influence on the spread of particles, are also shown. Two different diffusion regimes (local and intermediate) for each of the investigated flow conditions are confidently identified.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The concept of equal mobility of gravel transport is 2 decades old. The weak form of the hypothesis states that in order to transport the coarse half of the mean annual gravel load through a river reach at a rate equal to the fine half, the coarser material must be overrepresented on the bed surface, giving rise to a mobile-bed armor. The degree of mobile-bed armoring necessary to accomplish this diminishes with increasing bed shear stress. The strong form of the hypothesis states that the grain size distribution of the gravel portion of the bed load should be similar to that of the substrate and finer than that of the surface layer. Here the hypothesis is subjected to a rigorous test in the laboratory under controlled conditions which are nevertheless chosen to be as representative as possible of actual field conditions. The grain size distributions used in the experiment included both model “gravel” and model “sand.” At the end of the experiment the entire surface layer and a significant depth of substrate were removed from an entire reach of the channel and sieved. The results of the experiment confirmed the weak form of equal mobility: The surface layer was significantly coarsened compared with the bed load, even when the “sand” was excluded from the size distributions. The strong form of equal mobility was also supported by the experiment, in that the size distribution of the “gravel” substrate was nearly identical to the size distribution of the “gravel” portion of the load. The gravel substrate was, however, slightly but measurably coarser than the gravel load, a tendency that has been observed in the field in cases for which the strong form is not satisfied.},

abstract = {A geomorphic transport law is a mathematical statement derived from a physical principle or mechanism, which expresses the mass flux or erosion caused by one or more processes in a manner that: 1) can be parameterized from field measurements, 2) can be tested in physical models, and 3) can be applied over geomorphically significant spatial and temporal scales. Such laws are a compromise between physics-based theory that requires extensive information about materials and their interactions, which may be hard to quantify across real landscapes, and rules-based approaches, which cannot be tested directly but only can be used in models to see if the model outcomes match some expected or observed state. We propose that landscape evolution modeling can be broadly categorized into detailed, apparent, statistical and essential realism models and it is the latter, concerned with explaining mechanistically the essential morphodynamic features of a landscape, in which geomorphic transport laws are most effectively applied. A limited number of studies have provided verification and parameterization of geomorphic transport laws for: linear slope-dependent transport, non-linear transport due to dilational disturbance of soil, soil production from bedrock, and river incision into bedrock. Field parameterized geomorphic transport laws, however, are lacking for many processes including landslides, debris flows, surface wash, and glacial scour. We propose the use of high- resolution topography, as initial conditions, in landscape evolution models and explore the applicability of locally parameterized geomorphic transport laws in explaining hillslope morphology in the Oregon Coast Range. This modeling reveals unexpected morphodynamics, suggesting that the use of real landscapes with geomorphic transport laws may provide new insights about the linkages between process and form.},

abstract = {An expert-based approach was used to identify 10 morphological unit types within a reach of the gravel bed, regulated Yuba River, California, that is heavily utilized by spawning Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Analysis of these units was carried out using two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, field-based geomorphic assessment, and detailed spawning surveying. Differently classified morphological units tended to exhibit discrete hydraulic signatures. In most cases, the Froude number adequately differentiated morphological units, but joint depth-velocity distributions proved the most effective hydraulic classification approach. Spawning activity was statistically differentiated at the mesoscale of the morphological unit. Salmon preferred lateral bar, riffle, and riffle entrance units. These units had moderately high velocity (unit median {\textgreater} 0.45 m s- 1) and low depth (unit median {\textless} 0.6 m), but each exhibited a unique joint depth-velocity distribution. A large proportion of redds (79{\%}) were associated with conditions of convective flow acceleration at riffle and riffle entrance locations. In addition to reflecting microhabitat requirements of fish, it was proposed that the hydraulic segregation of preferred from avoided or tolerated morphological units was linked to the mutual association of specific hydraulic conditions with suitable caliber sediment that promotes the provision and maintenance of spawning habitat. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In natural flows, bed sediment particles are entrained and moved by the fluctuating forces, such as lift and drag, exerted by the overlying flow on the particles. To develop a better understanding of these forces and the relation of the forces to the local flow, the downstream and vertical components of force on near-bed fixed particles and of fluid velocity above or in front of them were measured synchronously at turbulence-resolving frequencies (200 or 500 Hz) in a laboratory flume. Measurements were made for a spherical test particle fixed at various heights above a smooth bed, above a smooth bed downstream of a downstream-facing step, and in a gravel bed of similarly sized particles as well as for a cubical test particle and 7 natural particles above a smooth bed. Horizontal force was well correlated with downstream velocity and not correlated with vertical velocity or vertical momentum flux. The standard drag formula worked well to predict the horizontal force, but the required value of the drag coefficient was significantly higher than generally used to model bed load motion. For the spheres, cubes, and natural particles, average drag coefficients were found to be 0.76, 1.36, and 0.91, respectively. For comparison, the drag coefficient for a sphere settling in still water at similar particle Reynolds numbers is only about 0.4. The variability of the horizontal force relative to its mean was strongly increased by the presence of the step and the gravel bed. Peak deviations were about 30{\%} of the mean force for the sphere over the smooth bed, about twice the mean with the step, and 4 times it for the sphere protruding roughly half its diameter above the gravel bed. Vertical force correlated poorly with downstream velocity, vertical velocity, and vertical momentum flux whether measured over or ahead of the test particle. Typical formulas for shear-induced lift based on Bernoulli's principle poorly predict the vertical forces on near-bed particles. The measurements suggest that particle-scale pressure variations associated with turbulence are significant in the particle momentum balance.},

The interactions between turbulence structures and initiation of particles movement is the key for better understand-ing of the physics of sediment transport and particles behaviour. These aims are addressed by use of a 3D relevant model of spherical saltating particles, in which a special procedure has been designed to produce coherent structures. In this method, the spectra of turbulent kinetic energy, consisting of four ranges, are used to generate the time series of turbulent velocities in the streamwise, vertical and transversal directions. Numerical results suggest that the initiation of sediment movement is strongly correlated to positive streamwise velocity fluctuations and as such, supports earlier laboratory ex-perimental and field observations, showing that the sweeps and outward interactions play a crucial role in the initiation of saltating particles' movement.},

Such models are highly dependent on arbitrary parameterization and such limitations prevent both the complexity of the system and the feedback between processes being accurately represented. It is suggested here that an improvement in the empirical transport relations used in the morphodynamic modelling of gravel-bed rivers can potentially be derived from a combined computational fluid dynamics approach linked with a discrete particle model. It is proposed that this form of model, used under different hydraulic conditions and sediment particle characteristics, could provide process informed ranges of particle size-specific entrainment, transport and deposition characteristics which can be encapsulated in a probability distribution. Such process information could then be used to improve spatial and/or temporal parameterizations of reach-length morphodynamic models.},

An Immersed Boundary Method is used for the numerical representation of the particles. With 22 points per diameter even the viscous scales of the flow are resolved at this Reynolds number. The reference run contains just as many fixed as mobile particles with a relative density slightly above the nominal threshold of incipient motion. Further runs were conducted with decreased mass loading and decreased Shields number together with a simulation containing only immobile particles. The variation of the parameters defining the mobile sediment yields a strong modification of particle-fluid as well as particle-particle interactions yielding different structures in space and time. This is assessed by means of appropriate statistical quantities addressing the continuous and the disperse phase.

abstract = {Discrete element modeling (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides an excellent platform to analyze fluid-particle systems. In all previous work, the fluid and particle systems are solved on a single grid. Contradictory requirements posed by resolution of fine scale fluid features such as turbulence, friction and heat transfer coefficient at immersed surfaces, and the resolution of important geometrical features, versus the necessity to maintain smoothness in particle solid fraction distribution on the chosen grid, often make single grid calculations untenable. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a novel two-grid technique in which a coarser particle grid is mapped on to a fine fluid grid. The technique uses suitable mappings to transfer fluid field variables from fluid-to-particle grid, and interphase transfer terms and void fractions from particle-to-fluid grid. The method is applied to a jetting fluidized bed of 750$\mu$m particles with a characteristic jet width of 1.6. mm. Results in the form of time-averaged void fractions and solid-velocity for two inlet jet velocities with single and multiple jets are compared to experiments. The results agree reasonably well with the experiments validating the two-grid approach for cases where single grid DEM-CFD would have been difficult to apply. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Numerical models in geomorphology and geophysics can be arranged along a continuum with 'simulation models' at one end and highly simplified, 'exploratory models' at the other. Simulation models are designed to reproduce a natural system as completely as possible; to simulate as wide a range of behaviors, in as much detail, and with as much quantitative accuracy as can be achieved. To accomplish this goal, a modeler typically strives to include all the processes that could significantly affect the quantitative accuracy of the model, and typically treats the processes in as much detail as is practical. In this case, model evaluation naturally consists of quantitatively comparing predicted variable values to corresponding measurements made in the field or laboratory. At the other end of this model spectrum, exploratory models arise when trying to discover what processes or interactions produce some poorly understood phenomenon—when searching for the clearest, simplest explanation. In this case, a modeler strives to include as few processes as possible while reproducing the poorly understood aspects of the phenomenon in question, to find the essential mechanisms. In exploratory models, quantitative accuracy is not as important as simplifying the formalism to investigate the general features of the interactions and feedbacks capable of causing a poorly understood behavior; a quantitatively accurate match with a wide variety of observations may not be expected. As with simulation models, a quantitative match with specific observations may be achievable by tuning parameters and the form of model interactions. However, a better model-testing strategy in these cases involves robust predictions that do not depend on the details of the formal representations of processes in the model, but result inevitably from the most general aspects of the model interactions. Testing such predictions can falsify the basic hypotheses the model is designed to explore.},

abstract = {A model of sand transport in water is produced by combining a turbulence-resolving large eddy simulation (LES) with a discrete element model (DEM) prescribing the motion of individual grains of medium sand. The momentum effect of each particle on the fluid is calculated at the LES cell containing the particle, and the fluid velocity and pressure, interpolated to each particle center, is used to derive fluid force on each particle in the DEM. Eleven numerical experiments are conducted of an initially flat bed of particles. The experiments span a range of motion, from essentially no motion to vigorous suspension. Hydraulic roughness is found to increase abruptly at the transition from bed load to suspended load transport. Suspended sediment extracts momentum from the flow and decreases the rate of shear. Whereas, slightly higher in the flow, vertical drag by suspended grains damps turbulence and increases the rate of shear. Vertical sediment diffusivity and effective particle settling velocity are much smaller than is commonly assumed in suspended sediment models. The bed load experiments suggest that saltation by itself is a poor model of bed load sand transport. In contrast to expectations from saltation models, the peak bed load flux occurs at essentially the same level as the bed, and grains move slowly in frequent contact with other grains. Higher- and faster-moving bed load grains that can be considered to be in saltation represent a smaller portion of the total flux. Entrainment of bed load grains occurs in response to fluid penetration of the bed by high-vorticity turbulence structures embedded within broader high speed fluid regions referred to as a sweeps or high-speed wedges.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Temporally and spatially averaged models of bedload transport are inadequate to describe the highly variable nature of particle motion at low transport stages. The primary sources of this variability are the resisting forces to downstream motion resulting from the geometrical relation (pocket friction angle) of a bed grain to the grains that it rests upon, variability of the near-bed turbulent velocity field and the local modification of this velocity field by upstream, protruding grains. A model of bedload transport is presented that captures these sources of variability by directly integrating the equations of motion of each particle of a simulated mixed grain-size sediment bed. Experimental data from the velocity field downstream and below the tops of upstream, protruding grains are presented. From these data, an empirical relation for the velocity modification resulting from upstream grains is provided to the bedload model. The temporal variability of near-bed turbulence is provided by a measured near-bed time series of velocity over a gravel bed. The distribution of pocket friction angles results as a consequence of directly calculating the initiation and cessation of motion of each particle as a result of the combination of fluid forcing and interaction with other particles. Calculations of bedload flux in a uniform boundary and simulated pocket friction angles agree favourably with previous studies.},

abstract = {The objective of this research is to study the relationship between the coherent flow structures and the hydrodynamic forces leading to entrainment of a spherical bed sediment particle for a rough bed uniform turbulent flow. Two types of experiments, namely, movable and fixed balls, were conducted using spherical roughness-element beds with particle image velocimetry to measure the instantaneous flow-velocity field. Miniature piezoelectric pressure sensors were used to capture the instantaneous pressure on the surface of the sphere. Movable ball experiments reveal the predominance of large sweep structures at the instant of entrainment. Fixed ball experiments carried out at entrainment conditions show the importance of both vertical and horizontal pressure gradients on the ball leading to entrainment. Probability distribution function plots of pressures based on quadrant analysis of velocities also reveal the higher probability of occurrence of high magnitude force induced by sweep ( Q4 ) events.},

abstract = {The inability of simulating the grain shapes of granular media accurately has been an outstanding issue preventing particle-based methods such as discrete element method from providing meaningful information for relevant scientific and engineering applications. In this study we propose a novel statistical method to generate virtual 3D particles with realistically complex yet controllable shapes and further pack them effectively for use in discrete-element modelling of granular materials. We combine the theory of random fields for spherical topology with a Fourier-shape-descriptor based method for the particle generation, and develop rigorous solutions to resolve the mathematical difficulties arising from the linking of the two. The generated particles are then packed within a prescribed container by a cell-filling algorithm based on Constrained Voronoi Tessellation. We employ two examples to demonstrate the excellent control and flexibility that the proposed method can offer in reproducing such key characteristics as shape descriptors (aspect ratio, roundness, sphericity, presence of facets, etc.), size distribution and solid fraction. The study provides a general and robust framework on effective characterization and packing of granular particles with complex shapes for discrete modelling of granular media.},

@article{Habersack2001,
abstract = {Hans A. Einstein initiated a probabilistic approach to modelling sediment transport in rivers. His formulae were based on theory and were stimulated by laboratory investigations. The theory assumes that bed load movement occurs in individual steps of rolling, sliding or saltation and rest periods. So far very few attempts have been made to measure stochastic elements in nature. For the first time this paper presents results of radio-tracing the travel path of individual particles in a large braided gravel bed river: the Waimakariri River of New Zealand. As proposed by Einstein, it was found that rest periods can be modelled by an exponential distribution, but particle step lengths are better represented by a gamma distribution. Einstein assumed an average travel distance of 100 grain-diameters for any bed load particle between consecutive points of deposition, but larger values of 6.7 m or 150 grain-diameters and 6.1 m or 120 grain-diameters were measured for two test particle sizes. Together with other available large scale field data, a dependence of the mean step length on particle diameter relative to the D-50 Of the bed surface was found. During small floods the time used for movement represents only 2.7{\%} of the total time from erosion to deposition. The increase in percentage of time being used for transport means that it then has to be regarded in stochastic transport models. Tracing the flow path of bed load particles between erosion and deposition sites is a step towards explaining the interactions between sediment transport and river morphology.

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features---using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model, our detection system has a frame rate of 5fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

abstract = {In natural flows, bed sediment particles are entrained and moved by the fluctuating forces, such as lift and drag, exerted by the overlying flow on the particles. To develop a better understanding of these forces and the relation of the forces to the local flow, the downstream and vertical components of force on near-bed fixed particles and of fluid velocity above or in front of them were measured synchronously at turbulence-resolving frequencies (200 or 500 Hz) in a laboratory flume. Measurements were made for a spherical test particle fixed at various heights above a smooth bed, above a smooth bed downstream of a downstream-facing step, and in a gravel bed of similarly sized particles as well as for a cubical test particle and 7 natural particles above a smooth bed. Horizontal force was well correlated with downstream velocity and not correlated with vertical velocity or vertical momentum flux. The standard drag formula worked well to predict the horizontal force, but the required value of the drag coefficient was significantly higher than generally used to model bed load motion. For the spheres, cubes, and natural particles, average drag coefficients were found to be 0.76, 1.36, and 0.91, respectively. For comparison, the drag coefficient for a sphere settling in still water at similar particle Reynolds numbers is only about 0.4. The variability of the horizontal force relative to its mean was strongly increased by the presence of the step and the gravel bed. Peak deviations were about 30{\%} of the mean force for the sphere over the smooth bed, about twice the mean with the step, and 4 times it for the sphere protruding roughly half its diameter above the gravel bed. Vertical force correlated poorly with downstream velocity, vertical velocity, and vertical momentum flux whether measured over or ahead of the test particle. Typical formulas for shear-induced lift based on Bernoulli's principle poorly predict the vertical forces on near-bed particles. The measurements suggest that particle-scale pressure variations associated with turbulence are significant in the particle momentum balance.},

abstract = {The paper reviews our recent attempts at modelling bed load transport in mountain rivers. This is a longstanding issue that has attracted considerable attention over the last century. While a number of field and laboratory studies have been instrumental in getting the big picture, there is a clear lack of efficient methods for predicting bed evolution and particle flux. Most approaches to bed load transport have emphasized the existence of a one-to-one relationship between the particle flux and water discharge, but this result conflicts with the spread of data, which often spans over several orders of magnitude. A possible interpretation lies in the significance of the fluctuations of the particle flux together with the propa-gation of bed forms. We have therefore developed a the-oretical model based on birth-death Markov processes to describe the random exchanges between the stream and bed, which then allows us to derive a governing equation for the particle flux fluctuations. We end up with the probability distribution function of the sediment trans-port rate. A striking feature is the existence of large fluctuations even under steady flow conditions. Numerical simulations have been carried out to com-pute the flow features, for the moment with no sediment transport. These simulations have shown that the kine-matic wave approximation (which leads to a significant simplification of the Saint-Venant equation into a non-linear advection equation) performs well for a wide range of water discharges. Remarkably, it has been found that under steady flow conditions, the local flow variables (wetted section and water discharge, or flow depth and mean velocity) exhibit a Froude similarity, i.e. regardless of the water discharge, the Froude number remains fairly constant at a given place of the river. Future work will consider the inclusion of a stochastic sediment transport equation in the Saint-Venant equations.},

abstract = {Recent studies have observed deviation from normal (Fickian) diffusion in sediment tracer dispersion that violates the assumption of statistical convergence to a Gaussian. Nikora et al. (2002) hypothesized that particle motion at short time scales is superdiffusive because of inertia, while long-time subdiffusion results from heavy-tailed rest durations between particle motions. Here we test this hypothesis with laboratory experiments that trace the motion of individual gravels under near-threshold intermittent bed load transport (0.027 {\textless} $\tau$* {\textless} 0.087). Particle behavior consists of two independent states: a mobile phase, in which indeed we find superdiffusive behavior, and an immobile phase, in which gravels distrained from the fluid remain stationary for long durations. Correlated grain motion can account for some but not all of the superdiffusive behavior for the mobile phase; invoking heterogeneity of grain size provides a plausible explanation for the rest. Grains that become immobile appear to stay at rest until the bed scours down to an elevation that exposes them to the flow. The return time distribution for bed scour is similar to the distribution of rest durations, and both have power law tails. Results provide a physical basis for scaling regimes of anomalous dispersion and the time scales that separate these regimes.},

Conditioned averaging is employed to extract the characteristic features of an erosion event, defining a suitable criterion for detection and accounting for possible asymmetry of flow structures. The highly resolved dataset provides detailed insight into the key-mechanisms of erosion. The results show that a particle collision, together with a subsequent sweep event on time scales of several bulk units, is responsible for the erosion.},

abstract = {Sediment tracers are increasingly employed to estimate bed load transport and landscape evolution rates. Tracer trajectories are dominated by periods of immobility (“waiting times”) as they are buried and reexcavated in the stochastically evolving river bed. Here we model bed evolution as a random walk with mean-reverting tendency (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) originating from the restoring effect of erosion and deposition. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model contains two parameters, a and b, related to the particle feed rate and range of bed elevation fluctuations, respectively. Observations of bed evolution in flume experiments agree with model predictions; in particular, the model reproduces the asymptotic t−1 tail in the tracer waiting time exceedance probability distribution. This waiting time distribution is similar to that inferred for tracers in natural gravel streams and avalanching rice piles, indicating applicability of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck mean-reverting model to many disordered transport systems with tracer burial and excavation. 1.},

The dominant harmonics in these motions have a primary influence on the rate at which the mean squared particle displacement R(tau) - a measure conventionally used to assess the possibility of anomalous diffusion - increases with the time interval tau. Over a timescale corresponding to the typical travel time of particles, calculations of R(tau) may ostensibly indicate non-Fickian behavior while actually reflecting the effects of periodicities in particle motions, not anomalous diffusion. We provide the theoretical basis for this observed behavior, and we illustrate how the effective (Fickian) particle diffusivity obtains from G. I. Taylor's classic definition involving the particle velocity autocovariance, including its relation to the ensemble-averaged particle velocity as articulated by O. M. Phillips. Cross-stream diffusivities are an order of magnitude smaller than streamwise diffusivities.},

Clusters are found to range in length from 0.11.2 m in a streamwise direction. Using flume experiments, it has been possible to simulate the formation of clusters resembling those found in natural channels. Observations of cluster formation indicate that these bedforms are developed during falling stage from flood discharges as particles are deposited around exceptionally large clasts which act as obstacles in the flow. Cluster bedforms play a significant role in sediment transport: they delay incipient motion and limit the availability of bed material for transportation.},

abstract = {Bedload transport is known to be a highly fluctuating temporal phenomenon, even under constant (mean) flow conditions, as a consequence of stochasticity, bedform migration, grain sorting, hysteresis, or sediment supply limitation. Because bedload transport formulas usually refer to a single mean transport value for a given flow condition, one can expect that prediction accuracy (when compared to measurements) will depend on the amplitude and duration of fluctuations, which in turn depend on the time scale used for observations. This paper aims to identify how the time scale considered can affect bedload prediction. This was done by testing 16 common bedload transport formulas with four data sets corresponding to different measurement period durations: (i) highly fluctuating (quasi-)instantaneous field measurements; (ii) volumes accumulated at the event scale on two small alpine gravel-bed rivers, potentially affected by seasonal fluctuations; (iii) volumes accumulated at the interannual scale in a meandering gravel bed river, thought to be weakly subject to fluctuations; (iv) time-integrated flume measurements with nearly uniform sediments. The tests confirmed that the longer the measurement period, the better the precision of the formula's prediction interval. They also demonstrate several consequential limitations. Most threshold formulas are no longer valid when the flow condition is below two times the threshold condition for the largest elements' motion on the bed surface (considering D84). In such conditions, equations either predict zero transport, or largely overestimate the real transport, especially when D84 is high. There is a need for new sediment data collected with highly reliable techniques such as recording slot bedload samplers to further investigate this topic.

Analysis of the solid discharge along the vertical displayed only one peak of rolling in the two-size bed, whereas three peaks of rolling appeared in the one-size case due to a larger collective motion. The same contrast is evidenced in spatio-temporal diagrams where the two-size mixtures are characterized by the predominance of saltation and a smaller number of transitions between rest and rolling.

abstract = {Even under flow equilibrium conditions, river bed topography continuously evolves with time, producing trains of irregular bed forms. The idea has recently emerged that the variability in the bed form geometry results from some randomness in sediment flux. In this paper, we address this issue by using the Exner equation and a population exchange model derived in an earlier paper. In this model, particle entrainment and deposition are idealized as population exchanges between the stream and the bed, which makes it possible to use birth-death Markov process theory to track the number of moving grains. The paper focuses on nascent bed forms on initially planar beds, a situation in which the coupling between the stream and bed is weak. In a steady state, the number of moving particles follows a negative binomial distribution. Although this probability distribution does not enter the family of heavy-tailed distributions, it may give rise to large and frequent fluctuations because the standard deviation can be much larger than the mean, a feature that is not accounted for with classic probability laws (e.g., Hamamori's law) used so far for describing bed load fluctuations. In the large-system limit, the master equation of the birth-death Markov process can be transformed into a Fokker-Planck equation. This transformation is used here to show that the number of moving particles can be described as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. An important consequence is that in the long term, the number of moving particles follows a Gaussian distribution. Laboratory experiments show that this approximation is correct when the mean number per unit length of stream, {\$}\backslashbar{\{}N{\}}{\$}/L, is sufficiently large (typically two particles per centimeter in our experiments). The particle number fluctuations give rise to bed elevation fluctuations, whose spectrum falls off like {\&}{\#}969;{\&}{\#}8722;2 in the high-frequency regime (with {\&}{\#}969; the angular frequency) and variance grows linearly with time. These features are in agreement with recent observations on bed form development (in particular, ripple growth).},

abstract = {It has been observed that the majority of particles in a granular material carries less than the average load and that the number of particles carrying larger than the average load decreases exponentially with increasing contact force. The particles carrying above average load appear to form a strong network of forces while the majority of particles belong to a weak network. The strong network of forces appear to have a spatial characteristic whereby the stronger forces are carried though chainlike particle groups referred to as force chains. There is a strong case for a connection between force chains of the discrete medium and the trajectory of the most compressive principal stress in its continuous idealization. While such properties seem obvious from descriptive analysis of physical and numerical experiments in granular media, progress in quantification of the force chain statistics requires an objective description of what constitutes a force chain. A procedure to quantify the occurrence of force chains is built on a proposed definition having two parts: first, the chain is a quasilinear arrangement of three or more particles, and second, along the chain, stress concentration within each grain is characterized by the vector delineating the most compressive principal stress. The procedure is incorporated into an algorithm that can be applied to large particle assemblies to compile force chain statistics. The procedure is demonstrated on a discrete element simulation of a rigid punch into a half space. It was found that only approximately half of the particles within the group of so-called strong network particles are part of force chains. Throughout deformation, the average length of force chains varied slightly but the number of force chains decreased as the punch advanced. The force chain lengths follow an exponential distribution. The procedure provides a tool for objective analysis of force chains, although future work is required to incorporate branching of force chains into the analysis.},

abstract = {A longstanding problem in the study of sediment transport in gravel-bed rivers is related to the physical mechanisms governing bed resistance and particle motion. To study this problem, we investigated the motion of coarse spherical glass beads entrained by a steady shallow turbulent water flow down a steep two-dimensional channel with a mobile bed. This experimental facility is the simplest representation of sediment transport on the laboratory scale, with the tremendous advantages that boundary conditions are perfectly controlled and a wealth of information can be obtained using imaging techniques. Flows were filmed from the side by a high-speed camera. Using image processing software made it possible to determine the flow characteristics such as particle trajectories, their state of motion (rest, rolling, or saltating motion), and flow depth. In accordance with earlier investigations, we observed that over short time periods, sediment transport appeared as a very intermittent process. To interpret these results, we revisited Einstein's theory on sediment and derived the statistical properties (probability distribution and autocorrelation function) of the key variables such as the solid discharge and the number of moving particles. Analyzing the autocorrelation functions and the probability distributions of our measurements revealed the existence of long-range correlations. For instance, whereas theory predicts a Binomial distribution for the number of moving particles, experiments demonstrated that a negative binomial distribution best fit our data, which emphasized the crucial role played by wide fluctuations. These frequent wide fluctuations stemmed particle entrainment and motion being collective phenomena rather than individual processes, contrary to what is assumed in most theoretical models.},

abstract = {Data from laboratory flumes and natural streams show that the critical Shields stress for initial sediment motion increases with channel slope, which indicates that particles of the same size are more stable on steeper slopes. This observation is contrary to standard models that predict reduced stability with increasing slope due to the added downstream gravitational force. Processes that might explain this discrepancy are explored using a simple force-balance model, including increased drag from channel walls and bed morphology, variable friction angles, grain emergence, flow aeration, and changes to the local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations. Surprisingly, increased drag due to changes in bed morphology does not appear to be the cause of the slope dependency because both the magnitude and trend of the critical Shields stress are similar for flume experiments and natural streams, and significant variations in bed morphology in flumes is unlikely. Instead, grain emergence and changes in local flow velocity and turbulent fluctuations seem to be responsible for the slope dependency due to the coincident increase in the ratio of bed-roughness scale to flow depth (i.e., relative roughness). A model for the local velocity within the grain-roughness layer is proposed based on a 1-D eddy viscosity with wake mixing. In addition, the magnitude of near-bed turbulent fluctuations is shown to depend on the depth-averaged flow velocity and the relative roughness. Extension of the model to mixed grain sizes indicates that the coarser fraction becomes increasingly difficult to transport on steeper slopes.},

abstract = {Bedload, the transport of sediment remaining in contact with the stream bed, has mainly been studied from the perspective of the correlation between fluid driving forces and the responding sediment flux. Yet grain–grain interactions are important and bedload should also be considered as a granular phenomenon. We review progress made recently in the study of granular flows, especially on segregation and rheology, that better illuminates the nature of bedload. Granular flows may exhibit gas-like or fluid-like flow, or quasi-solid deformation. All three conditions might be duplicated in bedload. Understanding of intense bedload transport occurring continuously in a layer several grains deep – typical of sand beds – might greatly benefit from results in granular physics, as illustrated by grain-inspired bedload results. However, processes restricted to the surface of the bed, when particles move intermittently and the bed becomes structured, while characteristic in gravel-bed channels, are not well addressed in granular physics. Mutual study of these phenomena may benefit both physics and fluvial geomorphology. We intend, therefore, to contribute to an enhanced dialogue between granular physics and bedload science communities. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A 1D finite-volume model has been established to simulate the nonequilibrium transport of nonuniform sediment with transient flows, such as dam-break flow and overtopping flow, over movable beds. The effects of sediment transport and bed change on the flow are considered in the flow continuity and momentum equations. An explicit algorithm is adopted to solve the governing equations. The model has been tested preliminarily in several experimental cases, including an experiment on wedge development due to sediment overloading under transcritical flow conditions, an experiment on dam surface erosion due to overtopping flow, and two experiments on dam-break flow over movable beds. The model performs quite well in the cases of wedge development and overtopping flow, but significantly under-predicts the bed erosion due to dam-break flow. A modification has thus been made by considering the effects of sediment concentration on sediment settling and entrainment in the case of dam-break flow over movable beds. The present model has been compared with the traditional movable-bed “clear-water” model that ignores the effects of sediment on the flow. It has been found that the present model provides more reasonable predictions, and the “clear-water” model has larger errors when sediment transport is stronger and may even fail in the case of dam-break flow.},

abstract = {A new criterion for the onset of entrainment of coarse sediment grains is presented here. It is hypothesized that not only the magnitude, but also the duration of energetic near bed turbulent events is relevant in predicting grain removal from the bed surface. It is therefore proposed that the product of force and its duration, or impulse, is a more appropriate and universal criterion for identifying conditions for particle dislodgement. This conjecture is investigated utilizing two theoretical models, representative of two modes of entrainment: saltation and rolling. In these models, instantaneous, highly fluctuating turbulent forces are simulated as short‐lived pulses of characteristic magnitude and duration, which transfer adequate fluid momentum to the particle, to trigger its entrainment. The analytical solution of the respective equations of motion is employed in deriving representations of threshold conditions in terms of the impulse characteristics. It is shown that hydrodynamic forces of sufficiently high magnitude are capable of entraining a particle only when they last long enough so that their impulse exceeds a critical value. To illustrate further the validity of the critical impulse concept, as well as extend and generalize its application to different entrainment levels of an individual grain, a novel experimental setup is utilized. This setup facilitates observations of angular displacement of a steel mobile particle in air due to electromagnetic pulses of different magnitude and duration. The experimentally obtained conditions for partial or complete entrainment support the concept of a critical impulse.},

A mix of fast and slow geomorphic processes, unknown initial and forcing conditions, unresolved heterogeneities, and unanticipated, typically nonlinear mechanisms make prediction difficult and problems of scale paramount. A variety of approaches to formulating geomorphic models exist, reflecting the diversity of modeler's backgrounds and goals and our incomplete understanding of many earth surface processes. Progress is facilitated by a continuing dialog among those pursuing different approaches to making and testing predictions. This paper provides a synopsis of contributions to a volume that focuses on the broader objectives, methods, and testing of geomorphic models. Why do we model and to what purpose? How do we formulate and test models? How do we evaluate whether a model has predictive capability or any utility at all? Is prediction even necessary? Despite the diverse approaches to making predictions in geomorphology, common themes in the volume highlight the need for models that unambiguously link cause and effect, the importance of rigorous and flexible model tests, and the utility of models in focusing and organizing understanding and expressing concepts in unambiguous and testable ways.},

@article{Pfeiffer2017,
abstract = {In many gravel-bedded rivers, floods that fill the channel banks create just enough shear stress to move the median-sized gravel particles on the bed surface (D50). Because this observation is common and is supported by theory, the coincidence of bankfull flow and the incipient motion of D50 has become a commonly used assumption. However, not all natural gravel channels actually conform to this simple relationship; some channels maintain bankfull stresses far in excess of the critical stress required to initiate sediment transport. We use a database of {\textgreater}300 gravel-bedded rivers and {\textgreater}600 10Be-derived erosion rates from across North America to explore the hypothesis that sediment supply drives the magnitude of bankfull shear stress relative to the critical stress required to mobilize the median bed surface grain size ($\tau$bf*/$\tau$c*). We find that $\tau$bf*/$\tau$c* is significantly higher in West Coast river reaches (2.35, n = 96) than in river reaches elsewhere on the continent (1.03, n = 245). This pattern parallels patterns in erosion rates (and hence sediment supplies). Supporting our hypothesis, we find a significant correlation between upstream erosion rate and local $\tau$bf*/$\tau$c* at sites where this comparison is possible. Our analysis reveals a decrease in bed surface armoring with increasing $\tau$bf*/$\tau$c*, suggesting channels accommodate changes in sediment supply through adjustments in bed surface grain size, as also shown through numerical modeling. Our findings demonstrate that sediment supply is encoded in the bankfull hydraulic geometry of gravel bedded channels through its control on bed surface grain size. },

abstract = {Sediment transport rates in steep mountain channels are typically an order of magnitude lower than predicted by models developed for lowland rivers. One hypothesis for this observation is that particles are more stable in mountain channels due to particle-particle interlocking or bridging across the channel width. This hypothesis has yet to be tested, however, because we lack direct measurements of particle friction angles in steep mountain channels. Here we address this data gap by directly measuring the minimum force required to dislodge sediment (pebbles to boulders) and the sediment weight in mountain channels using a handheld force gauge. At eight sites in California, with reach-averaged bed angles ranging from 0.5° to 23° and channel widths ranging from 2m to 16m, we show that friction angles in natural streams average 68° and are 16° larger than those typically measured in laboratory experiments, which is likely due to particle interlocking and burial. Results also show that larger grains are disproportionately more stable than predicted by existing models and that grains organized into steps are twice as stable as grains outside of steps. However, the mean particle friction angle does not vary systematically with bed slope. These results do not support systematic increases in friction angle in steeper and narrower channels to explain the observed low sediment transport rates in mountain channels. Instead, the spatial pattern and grain-size dependence of particle friction angles may indirectly lower transport rates in steep, narrow channels by stabilizing large clasts and channel-spanning steps, which act as momentum sinks due to form drag.},

abstract = {In 1989, Sir Sam Edwards made the visionary proposition to treat jammed granular materials using a volume ensemble of equiprobable jammed states in analogy to thermal equilibrium statistical mechanics, despite their inherent athermal features. Since then, the statistical mechanics approach for jammed matter has garnered an extraordinary amount of attention by both theorists and experimentalists. Here, we review a systematic approach to jammed matter based on the Edwards statistical mechanical ensemble. We discuss the construction of microcanonical and canonical ensembles based on the volume function, which replaces the Hamiltonian in jammed systems. The importance of approximation schemes at various levels is emphasized leading to quantitative predictions for ensemble averaged quantities such as packing fractions and contact force distributions. An overview of the phenomenology of jammed states and experiments, simulations, and theoretical models scrutinizing the strong assumptions underlying Edwards' approach is given including recent results suggesting the validity of Edwards ergodic hypothesis for jammed states. A theoretical framework for packings whose constitutive particles range from spherical to non-spherical shapes like dimers, polymers, ellipsoids, spherocylinders or tetrahedra, hard and soft, frictional, frictionless and adhesive, monodisperse and polydisperse particles in any dimensions is discussed providing insight into an unifying phase diagram for all jammed matter. Furthermore, the connection between the Edwards' ensemble of metastable jammed states and metastability in spin-glasses is established. This highlights that the packing problem can be understood as a constraint satisfaction problem for excluded volume and force and torque balance leading to a unifying framework between the Edwards ensemble of equiprobable jammed states and out-of-equilibrium spin-glasses.},

@article{Curran2005,
abstract = {In a series of flume experiments using constant discharge, flow depth, and gravel feed rate, sand feed rates were varied from 0.16 to 6.1 times that of gravel. The bed slope decreased with increasing sand supply, indicating that the gravel could be transported at the same rate, along with increasing amounts of sand, at smaller shear stresses. Prediction of river response to an increase in sediment supply requires prediction of mutual changes in bed composition and transport, and therefore a transport model defined in terms of the grain size of the bed surface. A recent model provides satisfactory prediction of the experimental observations and indicates the general response of gravel beds to increased sand supply. An increase in sand supply may increase the sand content of the river bed and the mobility of gravel fractions, which can lead to bed degradation and preferential evacuation of these sediments from the river.},

@article{Turowski2010,
abstract = {It has been known for a long time that sediment transport rates can vary strongly even if the ambient hydraulic conditions remain steady. In this article, a new approach is described to derive probability distributions of bed load transport rates, starting from the waiting time between the arrivals of individual sediment particles. The formalism should be valid when transport is not dominated by bed form motion. Without any assumptions about the distribution of interarrival times, the approach yields the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution, a two-parameter distribution previously used in lifetime modeling. Observed dependence of mean transport rates on the sampling time and multiscaling are predicted by the distribution. Assuming exponentially and Poisson-distributed interarrival times, the same approach yields the Poisson and the gamma distributions. Using a high-resolution bed load transport data set from the Pitzbach, Austria, the distribution functions are tested on field data. The gamma distribution best describes the data, with maximum deviations of similar to 5{\%}. However, the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution may be more useful in certain applications, as it is a general approximation in the proposed formalism and no debated assumptions are necessary for its derivation.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify a numerical method to simulate motion of a packed or fluidized bed of fuel particles in combustion chambers, such as a grate furnace and a rotary kiln. Therefore, the various numerical methods applied in the areas of granular matter and molecular dynamics were reviewed extensively. As a result, a time driven approach was found to be suited for the numerical simulation of particle motion in combustion chambers. Furthermore., this method can also be employed to moving boundaries which are required for the present application e.g. travelling grate. The method works in a Lagrangian frame of reference, which uses the position and orientation of particles as independent variables. These are obtained by time integration of the three-dimensional dynamics equations derived from the classical Newtonian approach for each particle. This includes the keeping track of all forces and momentums acting on each particle at every time step. Viscoelastic contact forces include normal and tangential components with viscoelastic models for energy dissipation and friction. The particle shapes are approximated by spheres and ellipsoids with a varying size and ratio of the semi-axis accounting for the variety of particle geometries in a combustion chamber. For these shapes the overlap of particles during contact is expressed by a polynomial of 4th order in the two-dimensional case and a polynomial of 6th order in the three-dimensional case. A new algorithm to detect two-dimensional elliptical particle contact with sufficient accuracy was developed. It is based on a sequence of coordinate transformations and has demonstrated its reliability in numerous applications. Finally, the method was applied to simulate the motion of spherical and elliptical particles in a rectangular enclosure, on a travelling grate, and in a rotary kiln.},

In this work, the development of a three-dimensional, massively parallel, and open-source CFD-DEM solver SediFoam is detailed. This solver is built based on open-source solvers OpenFOAM and LAMMPS. OpenFOAM is a CFD toolbox that can perform three-dimensional fluid flow simulations on unstructured meshes; LAMMPS is a massively parallel DEM solver for molecular dynamics. Several validation tests of SediFoam are performed using cases of a wide range of complexities. The results obtained in the present simulations are consistent with those in the literature, which demonstrates the capability of SediFoam for sediment transport applications. In addition to the validation test, the parallel efficiency of SediFoam is studied to test the performance of the code for large-scale and complex simulations. The parallel efficiency tests show that the scalability of SediFoam is satisfactory in the simulations using up to O(107) particles.},

The sensitivity of the particle friction factor, restitution coefficient, and spring stiffness used in the soft sphere collision model is tested in the three regimes of sediment transport comprising of essentially no motion, bed load, and suspended load flow regimes. The simulations are run for 10 s using base values of the parameters of interest (reference calculation), then one parameter is changed at a time and the corresponding change in quantitative result is observed for the following 15 s where averaged results in the last 10 s are compared to the reference calculation. The sensitivity analysis shows that the underpredicted sediment transport in the suspended load regime can be bridged by moderately decreasing the friction factor of the particles from 0.6 to 0.25. The impact of the same change in bed load regime is not as significant. Both the coefficient of restitution and the particle stiffness show less significant to negligible impact as compared to the friction factor.},

Furthermore, dam reservoirs are used for recreation, navigation and they provide safety in the downstream valleys against extreme flood events and droughts. All reservoirs are subjected to sedimentation which, without adequate prevention and mitigation counter-measures, threatens their sustainability. As well as the evident loss of storage capacity, the adequate and safe operation of water intakes and bottom outlets belonging to the vital outlet structures can be affected by the deposition of sediments in the reservoir. This Vision Paper first addresses the state-of-the-art and the main scientific advances in terms of prevention and mitigation measures against sedimentation in reservoirs. Then, the main research challenges, which result from the assessment of what are the remaining open questions, are pointed out. The emerging research methodologies to study sedimentation processes are also discussed.},

abstract = {The aim of this investigation was to experimentally examine the surface pressures and resulting forces on an individual sediment grain whose size is comparable to the scales of the turbulent channel flow in an effort to discern details of the flow/grain interaction. This was accomplished by measuring the pressure fluctuations on the surface of a coarse, fully exposed, spherical grain resting upon a bed of identical grains in open channel turbulent flow. This spherical particle was instrumented with low-range, high-frequency-response pressure transducers to measure the individual surface pressures simultaneously on its front, back, top and bottom. The local flow velocity was measured synchronously with a laser Doppler velocimeter. The flow and sediment are near threshold conditions for entrainment with the channel and particle Reynolds numbers varying between 31 000–39 000 and 330–440 respectively. The emphasis was on determining the characteristics of the flow field with the potential to dislodge a spherical grain under uniform flow conditions as well as in the wake of a circular cylinder placed spanwise across the flow in otherwise fully developed open channel flow. It is concluded that the streamwise velocity near the bed is most directly related to those force events (and associated individual surface pressure distributions) crucial for particle entrainment. The lift force was observed to momentarily reach values which can be consequential for particle stability, although it is poorly correlated with the fluctuating normal velocity component. Turbulence intensity near the bed, rather than being the causative factor for increased force fluctuations, was shown to be an indicator of changes in the average lift force experienced by the grain during the application of extreme drag forces, at least for this particular flow condition (the upstream, spanwise-mounted circular cylinder). This effect is known to alter the sediment transport rates significantly. The characteristics of the temporal durations of flow events about the local maxima in the stagnation pressure, drag and lift forces, using a conditional sampling method, revealed the prevalence of sweep-type near-bed flow events in generating favourable conditions for particle dislodgement, although the dominant feature is the positive streamwise velocity fluctuation, not the normal velocity component. The duration of such events was the highest in the fourth and first quadrants in the u, w plane, inducing high impulses on the grain.},

abstract = {This paper reports a radiofrequency identification (RFID) tracing experiment implemented in a high-sedimentload mountain stream typical of alpine gravel-bed torrents. The study site is the Bouinenc Torrent, a tributary to the Bl{\'{e}}one River in southeast France that drains a 389-km² degraded catchment. In spring 2008, we deployed 451 tracers with b-axis ranging from 23 to 520 mm. Tracers were seeded along eight cross-sections located in the upstream part of the lowest 23 km of the stream. Three tracer inventories were implemented in July 2008, 2009 and 2010. Recovery rates calculated for mobile tracers declined from 78{\%} in 2008 to 45{\%} in 2009 and 25{\%} in 2010. Observations of tracer displacement revealed very high sediment dispersion, with frontrunners having travelled more than 2 km only three months after their deployment. The declining recovery rate over time was interpreted as resulting from rapid dispersion rather than deep burial. We evaluated that 64{\%} of the tracers deployed in the active channel were exported from the 23-km study reach three years after the onset of the tracing experiment. Travel distances were characterized by right-skewed and heavy-tailed distributions, correctly fitted by a power-law function. This supports the idea that in gravel-bed rivers with abundant sediment supply relative to transport capacity, bedload transport can be viewed as a superdiffusive sediment dispersion process. It is also shown that tracers initially deployed in the low-flow channel were characterized by a 15- to 30-fold increase of mobility compared to tracers deployed in gravel bars.},

abstract = {High-speed imaging of coarse sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed reveals that the particle activity, the solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area, fluctuates as particles respond to near-bed fluid turbulence while simultaneously interacting with the bed. The relative magnitude of these fluctuations systematically varies with the size of the sampling area. The particle activity within a specified sampling area is distributed in a manner that is consistent with the existence of an ensemble of configurations of particle positions wherein certain configurations are preferentially selected or excluded by the turbulence structure, manifest as patchiness of active particles. The particle activity increases with increasing bed stress far faster than does the average particle velocity, so changes in the transport rate with changing stress are dominated by changes in the activity, not velocity. The probability density functions of the streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like and lack heavy tails. Plots of the mean squared particle displacement versus time may ostensibly indicate non-Fickian diffusive behavior while actually reflecting effects of correlated random walks associated with intrinsic periodicities in particle motions, not anomalous diffusion. The probability density functions of the particle hop distance (start-to-stop) and the associated travel time are gamma-like, which provides the empirical basis for showing that particle disentrainment rates vary with hop distance and travel time.},

abstract = {We report on bedload transport observations using piezoelectric bedload impact sensors (PBIS), an indirect method of estimating the volume of bedload transport of coarse sediment. The PBIS device registers vibrations produced by bedload (particle diameter {\textgreater}{\~{}}20 mm) and records the signal as a sum of the number of impulses per time. Sediment transport at the Erlenbach stream has been continuously monitored with a PBIS array starting in 1986. The sensor array spans the width of an entire cross-section and is mounted flush with the surface of a check dam immediately upstream of a sediment retention basin. We compare PBIS data with long-term sedimentation records obtained from repeated surveys of material stored in the sediment retention basin, with artificial sediment input under controlled conditions in the field, and also with laboratory experiments. The rate of bedload transport is proportional to the number of impacts on the sensor per unit time. The reliability of the calibration relationship increases with the length of the observation period, e.g. for higher numbers of impacts and larger bedload volumes. Sediment volumes for individual flood events estimated with the PBIS method are in agreement with volumes estimated using an independent empirical method based on the effective runoff volume of water, the peak water discharge, and the critical discharge for the onset of sediment trans- por},

abstract = {The entrainment of coarse sediment particles under the action of fluctuating hydrodynamic forces is investigated from an energy perspective. It is demonstrated that the entrainment of a grain resting on the channel boundary is possible when the instantaneous flow power transferred to it exceeds a critical level. Its complete removal from the bed matrix occurs only if the impinging flow events supply sufficient mechanical energy. The energy-based criterion is formulated theoretically for entrainment of individual spherical particles in both saltation and rolling modes. Out of the wide range of flow events that can perform mechanical work on a coarse grain, only those with sufficient power and duration or equivalent energy density and characteristic length scale may accomplish its complete dislodgement. The instantaneous velocity upstream of a mobile particle is synchronously recorded with its position, enabling the identification of the flow events responsible for grain entrainment by rolling at near incipient motion flow conditions. For each of the entrainment events, the energy transfer coefficient defined as the ratio of the mechanical work performed on the particle to the mean energy of the flow event responsible for its dislodgement obtains values ranging from 0.04 to 0.10. At the examined low-mobility flow conditions, the majority (about 80{\%}) of the energetic structures leading to complete particle entrainment have a characteristic length of about two to four particle diameters.},

We present a review of recent results from our previous works, which led to physical insights on these phenomena. These results were obtained from a systematic numerical study based on the accurate resolution - Direct Numerical Simulation via a pseudo-spectral approach - of the turbulent flow field, and on Lagrangian tracking of particles under different modelling assumptions. We underline the multiscale aspect of wall turbulence, which has challenged scientists to devise simple theoretical models adequate to fit experimental data, and we show that a sound rendering of wall turbulence mechanisms is required to produce a physical understanding of particle deposition and re-entrainment. This physical understanding can be implemented in more applied simulation techniques, such as Large-Eddy Simulation. Our arguments are based also on the phenomenology of coherent structures and on the examination of flow topology in connection with particle preferential distribution. Starting from these concepts, reasons why theoretical predictions may fail are examined together with the requirements which must be fulfilled by suitable predictive models. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Field measurements of sediment transport in gravel bed rivers often reveal hysteretic effects due to differences in sediment availability between the rising and falling limbs of a flood hydrograph. However, only a small number of flume studies have analyzed the dynamics of sediment transport during hydrographs. Three types of stepped hydrographs with contrasting durations and magnitudes are simulated here under sediment recirculation conditions. Bed load transport rate and grain size have been measured continuously. The dynamic behavior of the surface armor layer has been explored by analyzing digital photographs and laser scanner surveys of the bed surface taken during hydrographs. The results indicate that sediment transport during the falling limb was lower than during the rising limb in all of the three types of hydrographs. This reduction is more evident for the low-magnitude hydrographs. The grain size of the bed remained virtually constant throughout the hydrographs but the grain size of transported sediments exhibited a counterclockwise hysteresis. Also, a significant increase in the reference shear stress for sediment entrainment was measured during the falling limb of hydrographs. Additionally, a detailed analysis of partial transport dynamics of the bed surface sediments reveals a reduction in sediment mobility during the falling limb of the hydrographs. The difference in sediment entrainment and transport before and after the peak of the hydrographs appears to be caused by a change in the organization of the surface sediments. An analysis of detailed laser scan bed surveys reveals a phase of bed restructuring (lower vertical roughness, clast rearrangement) during the falling limb of hydrographs. Consequently, changes in the degree of organization and complexity of the bed surface are likely the cause of the reduced mobility of sediments, and thus of the reduced sediment transport rate, during the falling limb of the hydrographs.

abstract = {Direct consequences of the human role, where human activity affects river channels through engineering works including channelization, dam construction, diversion and culverting, have been long recognised [Marsh, G.P., 1864. Man and Nature or Physical Geography as Modified by Human Action. Charles Scribner, New York; Thomas Jr., W.L., (ed.) 1956. Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth. Chicago, University of Chicago Press, Chicago.]. The less obvious indirect effects of point and reach changes occurring downstream and throughout the basin, however, are much more recently appreciated, dating from key contributions by Strahler [Strahler, A.N., 1956. The nature of induced erosion and aggradation. In W. L. Thomas (Ed.), Man's Role in Changing the Face of the Earth. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 621-638.], Wolman [Wolman, M.G., 1967. A cycle of sedimentation and erosion in urban river channels. Geografiska Annaler 49A, 385-95.], Schumm [Schumm, S.A., 1969. River metamorphosis. Proceedings American Society of Civil Engineers, Journal Hydraulics Division 95, 255-73.], and Graf [Graf, W.L., 1977. The rate law in fluvial geomorphology. American Journal of Science, 277, 178-191.]. These are complemented by effects of alterations of land use, such as deforestation, intensive agriculture and incidence of fire, with the most extreme effects produced by building activity and urbanisation. Changing river channels are most evident in the channel cross-section where changes of size, shape and composition are now well-established, with up to tenfold increases or decreases illustrated by results from more than 200 world studies. In addition the overall channel planform, the network and the ecology have changed. Specific terms have become associated with changing river channels including enlargement, shrinkage and metamorphosis. Although the scope of adjustment has been established, it has not always been possible to predict what will happen in a particular location, because of complex response and contingency. The ways in which changes in cross-section relate to reach and network changes are less clear, despite investigations showing the distribution of changes along segmented channels. When considering the human role in relation to changing river channels, at least five challenges persist. First, because prediction of the nature and amount of likely change at a particular location is not certain, and because the contrasting responses of humid and arid systems needs to be considered, modelling is required to reduce uncertainty, as was first emphasised by Burkham [Burkham, D.E., 1981. Uncertainties resulting from changes in river form. American Society Civil Engineers Proceedings, Journal Hydraulics Division 107, 593-610.]. Second, feedback effects incorporated within the relationship between changes at channel, reach and network scales can have considerable implications, especially because changes now evident may have occurred, or have been initiated, under different environmental conditions. Third, consideration of global climate change is imperative when considering channel sensitivity and responses to threshold conditions. Fourth, channel design involving geomorphology should now be an integral part of restoration procedures. This requires, fifthly, greater awareness of different cultures as a basis for understanding constraints imposed by legislative frameworks. Better understanding of the ways in which the perception of the human role in changing river channels varies with culture as well as varying over time should enhance application of design for river channel landscapes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {At the reach scale, a channel adjusts to sediment supply and flow through mutual interactions among channel form, bed particle size, and flow dynamics that govern river bed mobility. Sediment can impair the beneficial uses of a river, but the timescales for studying recovery following high sediment loading in the field setting make flume experiments appealing. We use a flume experiment, coupled with field measurements in a gravel-bed river, to explore sediment transport, storage, and mobility relations under various sediment supply conditions. Our flume experiment modeled adjustments of channel morphology, slope, and armoring in a gravel-bed channel. Under moderate sediment increases, channel bed elevation increased and sediment output increased, but channel planform remained similar to pre-feed conditions. During the following degradational cycle, most of the excess sediment was evacuated from the flume and the bed became armored. Under high sediment feed, channel bed elevation increased, the bed became smoother, mid-channel bars and bedload sheets formed, and water surface slope increased. Concurrently, output increased and became more poorly sorted. During the last degradational cycle, the channel became armored and channel incision ceased before all excess sediment was removed. Selective transport of finer material was evident throughout the aggradational cycles and became more pronounced during degradational cycles as the bed became armored. Our flume results of changes in bed elevation, sediment storage, channel morphology, and bed texture parallel those from field surveys of Redwood Creek, northern California, which has exhibited channel bed degradation for 30 years following a large aggradation event in the 1970s. The flume experiment suggested that channel recovery in terms of reestablishing a specific morphology may not occur, but the channel may return to a state of balancing sediment supply and transport capacity.},

abstract = {Sediment-laden flows are a complex solid-fluid interaction process. This study presents a multimode morphodynamic model system combined with shallow water theory and a nonequilibrium assumption for sediment transport. The model system aims to simulate the morphological change caused by sediment-laden flows with various sediment transport modes. It involves three modules: a hydrodynamic module, a sediment transport module, and a morphological evolution module. The hydrodynamic model is governed by modified shallow water equations considering the interaction effects of flow and sediment. A flexible sediment transport model is presented that incorporates a weight coefficient. The model can adaptively choose an appropriate transport mode according to local, real-time flow conditions. Bedload, suspended load, and total mixed sediment load are all involved. The model is solved by a second-order Godunov-type finite-volume method that is robust and accurate. Validation is demonstrated through a series of test cases. The results indicate that the model can attain good agreement with measured data, thereby demonstrating the capabilities of the multimode morphodynamic model system in predicting sediment-laden flows and resulting morphological change.},

abstract = {Estimates of sediment transport rates in gravel-bed rivers are typically developed from formulae or from a sampling campaign. The former are notoriously inaccurate; the latter require a large effort and may still not achieve acceptable accuracy. A wide range of geomorphological problems, particularly those at the watershed scale, could be addressed more accurately if reliable local estimates of transport rate could be incorporated routinely into such studies. This requires a method for estimating transport rate with acceptable accuracy and a minimum of effort. A consistent approach to estimating transport is not just a matter of which formula or sampler to use; a suitable approach requires a consistent and reliable scaling of the water discharge and an integral description of the sediment that is both meaningful and practical. An approach proposed here, using a few observations of small transport rates to calibrate a transport formula, is likely to provide a superior combination of accuracy and effort and substantially reduces flow-scaling error. Small transport rates can be measured effectively using pit samplers, which allow the sampling periods needed for accurate measurements. Grain size can be represented as two fractions, sand and gravel, which capture some of the important transport dynamics and effectively represent important environmental problems within a tractable methodological approach. The approach is nearly independent of the uncertainty associated with measuring slope and bed grain-size in the field. Copyright},

Moreover, although there are numerous guides for conducting literature reviews, none focuses squarely on theory development. We fill this dual shortage by identifying and describing theory-mining reviews, literature reviews that explicitly extract and synthesize the elements of theory from primary studies. Our citation analysis finds that such reviews in information systems have been more highly cited than other kinds of reviews, whether authored by senior or by junior scholars. We present detailed guidelines for conducting a systematic literature review (also known as a systematic review) that develops three different kinds of theory-mining reviews: scoping out a theoretical landscape, contending for a new theoretical model, or rigorously testing a proposed theory. These guidelines are particularly tailored for information systems research, but are sufficiently general to be readily applicable in a wide range of social sciences, so that researchers can stand on the shoulders of foregoing scholarly giants to see farther with new, insightful theories.},

abstract = {We provide a probabilistic definition of the bed load sediment flux. In treating particle positions and motions as stochastic quantities, a flux form of the Master equation (a general expression of conservation) reveals that the volumetric flux involves an advective part equal to the product of an average particle velocity and the particle activity (the solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area), and a diffusive part involving the gradient of the product of the particle activity and a diffusivity that arises from the second moment of the probability density function of particle displacements. Gradients in the activity, instantaneous or time-averaged, therefore effect a particle flux. Time-averaged descriptions of the flux involve averaged products of the particle activity, the particle velocity and the diffusivity; the significance of these products depends on the scale of averaging. The flux form of the Exner equation looks like a Fokker-Planck equation (an advection-diffusion form of the Master equation). The entrainment form of the Exner equation similarly involves advective and diffusive terms, but because it is based on the joint probability density function of particle hop distances and associated travel times, this form involves a time derivative term that represents a lag effect associated with the exchange of particles between the static and active states. The formulation is consistent with experimental measurements and simulations of particle motions reported in companion papers.},

abstract = {We report an experimental investigation of the motion of bed load particles under steady and spatially uniform turbulent flow above a flat sediment bed of uniform grain size. Using a high-speed video imaging system, we recorded the trajectories of the moving particles and measured their velocity and the length and duration of their flights, as well as the surface density of the moving particles. Our observations show that entrained particles exhibit intermittent motion composed of the succession of periods of {\&}8220;flight{\&}8221; and periods of rest. During one flight, a particle may go through phases of reptation, during which it moves in nearly persistent contact with the rough bed, and phases of saltation, during which it travels sufficiently high above the bed to reach high velocities. The distributions of longitudinal and transverse particle velocities obey a decreasing exponential and a Gaussian law, respectively. Interestingly, these observations are similar to those previously reported for viscous flows. The experimental results presented here support the erosion-deposition model of Charru (2006) and allow the calibration of the involved coefficients. In particular, noting {\&}964;, the Shields number, and {\&}964;c, the threshold Shields number, we find that (1) the surface density of moving particles increases linearly with {\&}964; {\&}8722; {\&}964;c; (2) the average particle velocity increases linearly with {\&}964;1/2 {\&}8722; {\&}964;c1/2, with a finite nonzero value at the threshold; (3) the flight duration scales with a characteristic settling time with no significant dependence on either {\&}964; or the settling Reynolds number; and (4) the flight length increases linearly with {\&}964;1/2 {\&}8722; {\&}964;c1/2. The results presented in this paper should provide a valuable physical framework to describe bed form development in turbulent flows.},

abstract = {1 It is a truism in geomorphology that climatic events operate on a landscape to drive sediment transport processes, yet few investigations have formally linked climate and terrain characteristics with geomorphological processes. In this study, we incorporate sediment transport equations derived from fieldwork into a computer model that predicts the delivery of sediment from hillslopes in a steep Mediterranean landscape near Santa Barbara, California. The sediment transport equations are driven by rainstorms and fires that are stochastically generated from probability distributions. The model is used to compare the rates and processes of sediment delivery under two vegetation types: coastal sage scrub and grasslands. Conversion of vegetation from sage to exotic grasses is a common land management strategy in the region and may also be engendered by regional climate change due to global warming. Results from the model suggest that (1) approximately 40{\%} more sediment is delivered from grasslands (98 t km(-2) yr(-1)) than the sage scrub (71 t km(-2) yr(-1)) and (2) chronic soil creep processes dominate under grasslands whereas catastrophic processes dominate under coastal sage scrub. Results from the model also suggest that changes in the spatial distribution of vegetation arising from climate change will have a greater effect on sediment delivery than changes in the magnitude and frequency of meteorological events.},

abstract = {1 We introduce a new conceptual model for longitudinal and transverse diffusion of moving bed particles under weak bed load transport. For both rolling/sliding and saltating modes the model suggests that the particle motion is diffusive and comprises at least three ranges of temporal and spatial scales with different diffusion regimes: (1) the local range (ballistic diffusion), (2) the intermediate range (normal or anomalous diffusion), and (3) the global range (subdiffusion). The local range corresponds to ballistic particle trajectories between two successive collisions with the static bed particles. The intermediate range corresponds to particle trajectories between two successive periods of rest. These trajectories consist of many local trajectories and may include tens or hundreds of collisions with the bed. The global range of scales corresponds to particle trajectories consisting of many intermediate trajectories, just as intermediate trajectories consist of many local trajectories. Our data from the Balmoral Canal (the intermediate range) and Drake et al.'s 1988 data from the Duck Creek (the global range) provide strong support for this conceptual model and identify anomalous diffusion regimes for the intermediate range (superdiffusion) and the global range (subdiffusion).},

abstract = {Scope.-The finer debris transported by a stream is borne in suspension. The coarser is swept along the channel bed. The suspended load is readily sampled and estimated, and much is known as to its quantity. The bed load is inaccessible and we are without definite information as to its amount. The primary purpose of the investigation was to learn the laws which control the movement of bed load, and especially to determine how the quantity of load is related to the stream's slope and discharge and to the degree of comminution of the debris. Method.-To this end a laboratory was equipped at Berkeley, Cal., and experiments were performed in which each of the three conditions mentioned was separately varied and the resulting variations of load were observed and measured. Sand and gravel were sorted by sieves into grades of uniform size. Determinate discharges were used. In each experiment a specific load was fed to a stream of specific width and discharge, and measurement was made of the slope to which the stream automatically adjusted its bed so as to enable the current to transport the load. The slope factor.-For each combination of discharge, width, and grade of debris there is a slope, called competent slope, which limits transportation. With lower slopes there is no load, or the stream has no capacity for load. With higher slopes capacity exists; and increase of slope gives increase of capacity. The value of capacity is approximately proportional to a power of the excess of slope above competent slope. If S equal the stream's slope and sigma equal competent slope, then the stream's capacity varies as (S - sigma)n. This is not a deductive, but an empiric law. The exponent n has not a fixed value, but an indefinite series of values depending on conditions. Its range of values in the experience of the laboratory is from 0.93 to 2.37, the values being greater as the discharges are smaller or the debris is coarser. The discharge factor.-For each combination of width, slope, and grade of debris there is a competent discharge, k. Calling the stream's discharge Q, the stream's capacity varies as (Q - k)o. The observed range of values for o is from 0.81 to 1.24, the values being greater as the slopes are smaller or the debris is coarser. Under like conditions o is less than n; or, in other words, capacity is less sensitive to change3 of discharge than to changes of slope. The fineness factor.-For each combination of width, slope, and discharge there is a limiting fineness of debris below which no transportation takes place. Calling fineness (or degree of comminution) F and competent fineness o, the stream's capacity varies with (F - o)p. The observed range of values for p is from 0.50 to 0.62, the values being greater as slopes and discharges are smaller. Capacity is less sensitive to changes in fineness of debris than to changes in discharge or slope. The form factor.-Most of the experiments were with straight channels. A few with crooked channels yielded nearly the same estimates of capacity. The ratio of depth to width is a more important factor. For any combination of slope, discharge, and fineness it is possible to reduce capacity to zero by making the stream very wide and shallow or very narrow and deep. Between these extremes is a particular ratio of depth to width, p, corresponding to a maximum capacity. The values of p range, under laboratory conditions, from 0.5 to 0.04, being greater as slope, discharge, and fineness are less. Velocity.-The velocity which determines capacity for bed load is that near the stream's bed, but attempts to measure bed velocity were not successful. Mean velocity was measured instead. To make a definite comparison between capacity and mean velocity it is necessary to postulate constancy in some accessory condition. If slope be the constant, in which case velocity changes with discharge, capacity varies on the average with the 3.2 power of velocity. If discharge be the constant, in which case velocity changes with slope, capacity varies on the average with the 4.0 power of velocity. If depth be the constant, in which case velocity changes with simultaneous changes of slope and discharge, capacity varies on the average with the 3.7 power of velocity. The power expressing the sensitiveness of capacity to changes of mean velocity has in each case a wide range of values, being greater as slope, discharge, and fineness are less. Mixtures.-In general, debris composed of particles of a single size is moved less freely than debris containing particles of many sizes. If fine material be added to coarse, not only is the total load increased but a greater quantity of the coarse material is carried. Modes of transportation; movement of particles.-Some particles of the bed load slide; many roll; the multitude make short skips or leaps, the process being called saltation. Saltation grades into suspension. When particles of many sizes are moved together the larger ones are rolled. Modes of transportation; collective movement.-When the conditions are such that the bed load is small, the bed is molded into hills, called dunes, which travel downstream. Their mode of advance is like that of eolian dunes, the current eroding their upstream faces and depositing the eroded material on the downstream faces. With any progressive change of conditions tending to increase the load, the dunes eventually disappear and the debris surface becomes smooth. The smooth phase is in turn succeeded by a second rhythmic phase, in which a system of hills travel upstream. These are called antidunes, and their movement is accomplished by erosion on the downstream face and deposition on the upstream face. Both rhythms of debris movement are initiated by rhythms of water movement. Application of formulas.-While the principles discovered in the laboratory are necessarily involved in the work of rivers, the laboratory formulas are not immediately available for the discussion of river problems. Being both empiric and complex, they will not bear extensive extrapolation. Under some circumstances they may be used to compare the work of one stream with that of another stream of the same type, but they do not permit an estimate of a river's capacity to be based on the determined capacities of laboratory streams. The investigation made an advance in the direction of its primary goal, but the goal was not reached. Load versus energy.-The energy of a stream is measured by the product of its discharge (mass per unit tune), its slope, and the acceleration of gravity. In a stream without load the energy is expended in flow resistances, which are greater as velocity and viscosity are greater. Load, including that carried in suspension and that dragged along the bed, affects the energy in three ways. (1) It adds its mass to the mass of the water and increases the stock of energy pro rata. (2) Its transportation involves mechanical work, and that work is at the expense of the stream's energy. (3) Its presence restricts the mobility of the water, in effect increasing its viscosity, and thus consumes energy. For the finest elements of load the third factor is more important than the second; for coarser elements the second is the more important. For each element the second and third together exceed the first, so that the net result is a tax on the stream's energy. Each element of load, by drawing on the supply of energy, reduces velocity and thus reduces capacity for all parts of the load. This principle affords a condition by which total capacity is limited. Subject to this condition a stream's load at any time is determined by the supply of debris and the fineness of the available kinds. Flume transportation.-In the experiments described above - experiments illustrating stream transportation - the load traversed a plastic bed composed of its own material. Other experiments were arranged in which the load traversed a rigid bed, the bottom of a flume. Capacities are notably larger for flume transportation than for stream transportation, and their laws of variation are different. Rolling is an important mode of progression. For rolled particles the capacity increases with coarseness, for leaping particles with fineness. Capacity increases with slope and usually with discharge also, but the rates of increase are less than in stream transportation. Capacity is reduced by roughness of bed. Vertical velocity curve.-The vertical distribution of velocities in a current is controlled by conditions. The level of maximum velocity may have any position in the upper three-fourths of the current. In loaded streams its position is higher as the load is greater. In unloaded streams its position is higher as the slope is steeper, as the discharge is greater, and as the bed is rougher. Pilot tube.-The constant of the Pitot velocity gage - the ratio between the head realized and the theoretic velocity head - is not the same in all parts of a conduit, being less near the water surface and greater near the bottom or side of the conduit.},

abstract = {Motion pictures taken at Duck Creek, a clear stream 6.5 m wide and 35 cm deep near Yinedale, Wyoming, provide detailed, quantitative information on both the modes of motion of individual bedload particles and the collective motions of large numbers of them. Bed shear stress was approximately 6 Pa (60 dyncs cm-2), which was about twice the threshold for movement of the 4 mm median diameter fine gravel bed material ; and transport was almost entirely as bedload. The displacements of individual particles occurred mainly by rolling of the majority of the particles and saltation of the smallest ones, and rarely by brief sliding of large, angular ones. Entrainment was principally by rollover of the larger particles and liftoff of the smaller ones, and infrequently by ejection caused by impacts, whereas distrainment was primarily by diminution of fluid forces in the case of rolling particles and by collisions with larger bed particles in the case of saltating ones. The displacement times averaged about 0.2-0.4 s and generally were much shorter than the intervening rcpose times. The collective motions of the particles were characterized by frequent, brief, localized, random sweep- transport events of very high rates of entrainment and transport, which in the aggregate transported approximately 70?4 of the total load moved. These events occurred 9 YO of the time at any particular point of the bed, lasted 1-2 s, affected areas typically 20--50 cm long by 10-20 cm wide, and involved bedload concentrations approximately 10 times greater than background. The distances travelled during displacements averaged about 15 times the particle diameter. Despite the differences in their dominant modes of movement, the 8- 16 mm particles typically travelled only about 30{\%} slower during displacement than the 2 4 mm ones, whose speeds averaged 21 cm s-'. Particles starting from the same point not only moved intermittently downstream but also dispersed both longitudinally and transversely, with diffusivities of 4.6 and 0.26 em's-', respectively. The bedload transport rates measured from the films were consistent with those determined conventionally with a bedload sampler. The 2-4 mm particles were entrained 6 times faster on finer areas of the bed, where 8-16 mm particles covered 6 {\%} of the surface area, than on coarser ones, where they covered 12 YOe, ven though 2 4 and 4-8 mm particles covered practically the same percentage areas in both cases. The 4-8 and 8-16 mm particles, in contrast, were cntrsined at the same rates in both cases. To within the statistical uncertainty, the rates of distrainment balanced the rates of entrainment for all three sizes, and were approximately proportional to the corresponding concentrations of bedload.},

@article{Zimmermann2010a,
abstract = {Frequently, an assessment of the mean water velocity in a stream is necessary to estimate the discharge associated with a particular flow depth or, conversely, the mean depth associated with a particular discharge. In the absence of a direct measurement of flow velocity, a flow resistance approach, which establishes the relation between depth and velocity, can be applied. Two approaches have been used in the past: traditional approaches based on the use of a resistance coefficient (e.g., Darcy-Weisbach) or dimensionless hydraulic geometry approaches. To examine if one approach is more appropriate for steep streams, data from 31 flume experiments conducted to examine flow resistance in self-formed cascade channels were analyzed. A dimensionless hydraulic geometry approach developed using at-a-station data to characterize the q* exponent and between-site data to characterize the exponent on the channel slope term was more accurate than more traditional approaches. The developed relation was similar to the established rational relation (v {\&}{\#}945; g0.2q0.6s{\&}{\#}8722;0.4S0.2), suggesting that the rational relation has merit. The approach does not utilize a flow partitioning approach since, in steep streams with small relative depths, the grains themselves generate form and spill resistance. The observation that a single dimensionless hydraulic geometry flow resistance relation can describe measurements across a range of grain sizes and bed slopes (3{\&}{\#}8211;21{\%}) suggests that steep streams may follow a single scaling relation similar to the regime equations associated with lowland rivers.},

abstract = {An experimental study of lift force on a spherical sediment particle at different exposures was conducted in a laboratory flume. It is found that the functional form of the theoretical probability density function (pdf) of lift force similar to that of drag force is inadequate. An improved expression for the pdf based on the normal error law is provided which matches the measured data up to ±3 times the standard deviation of lift force for all exposures. The skewness of the measured lift force is found to increase with increase in exposure. In addition, the kurtosis of the measured lift force is found to be higher than that for a normal distribution for all exposures, resulting in higher probability of occurrence of extreme events (beyond ±3 times standard deviation). A spectral density function of lift force as a function of streamwise and stream-normal velocity is developed and validated using the measured lift force data. The spectrum predicted by the proposed model closely follows the measured spectrum for exposures 7.5 mm and 10 mm while it over predicts at frequencies below 1 Hz for exposures 0 mm and 2.5 mm because of poor coherence between lift force and streamwise velocity. The time history plots of measured lift at lower exposures showed that the high-frequency positive and negative fluctuations of lift correspond to strongly positive streamwise velocity fluctuations, a phenomenon not captured by the predictive model. Predominance of fluctuating Bernoulli's lift over lift due to stream-normal velocity fluctuations is observed at all exposures, more so in the case of lower exposures.},

abstract = {Can we recover a signal f (element of) R{\^{}}N from a small number of linear measurements? A series of recent papers developed a collection of results showing that it is surprisingly possible to reconstruct certain types of signals accurately from limited measurements. In a nutshell, suppose that f is compressible in the sense that it is well-approximated by a linear combination of M vectors taken from a known basis Psi. Then not knowing anything in advance about the signal, f can (very nearly) be recovered from about M logN generic nonadaptive measurements only. The recovery procedure is concrete and consists in solving a simple convex optimization program. In this paper, we show that these ideas are of practical significance. Inspired by theoretical developments, we propose a series of practical recovery procedures and test them on a series of signals and images which are known to be well approximated in wavelet bases. We demonstrate empirically that it is possible to recover an object from about 3M–5M projections onto generically chosen vectors with the same accuracy as the ideal M-term wavelet approximation. We briefly discuss possible implications in the areas of data compression and medical imaging.},

We have validated through laboratory experiments and analytical formulation of the problem a criterion based upon the impulse imparted to a sediment grain.

abstract = {This paper continues the investigation of the motion of solitary grains in a water stream, reported by Francis (1973). The trajectories of solid grains are photographed by a multi-exposure technique as they are propelled by water streams along the bed of a laboratory channel. Many thousands of photographs were taken and analysed to determine the positions, velocities and accelerations of the grain. The technique does not take into account the possible effect, in multi-grain transport, of inter? granular collisions. The three different modes of transport of grains were all observed - rolling, saltation and suspension, and the proportion of each found for a variety of transport stage u*ju*Q. The development of suspension is much less rapid than the development of saltation from rolling, but even at the highest stage used, about 3.0, there is still a small amount of rolling. The trajectory dimensions and geometry are shown in relation to the stage which uniquely determines the geometry. Experiments where the grain is suddenly entrained from a stationary position show that several features of the subsequent trajectory are the same as those of a trajectory with a prior history of movement: thus it is inferred that the start of a trajectory is by way of hydro- dynamic forces rather than by the conservation of momentum of previous trajectories. Impacts and trajectories were analysed for the coefficient of friction tan a and for the height of the effective thrust. While tan {\textless} x is shown to be rather larger than has been suspected in the past, the variation of throws light upon predominance of slow fluid near the bed rather than high speed inrushes of fast fluid. Better information is now available for finding the mean forward speed of grains compared to that presented in the earlier paper. There are grounds for believing the existence of a ‘ shear-drift' force on grains when they are in a velocity gradient, giving a force oppos? ing gravity: but there is no evidence of a proximity effect of the bed independent of the velocity gradien},

abstract = {Particles transported as bed load within a specified streambed area possess at any instant a distribution of velocities. This distribution figures prominently in describing the rates of transport and dispersal of particles. High-speed imaging of sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed reveals that the probability density functions of the streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like. For quasi-steady conditions the exponential-like density of streamwise velocities reflects a balance among three fluxes in momentum space: (1) an advection of streamwise momentum whose magnitude and sign vary with the momentum state; (2) a diffusion of momentum from higher to lower values of momentum density; and (3) a drift of momentum from regions in momentum space having high average rates of generation of kinetic energy toward regions having low rates of generation of kinetic energy. The probability density of cross-stream velocities similarly reflects a balance of fluxes of cross-stream momentum. Whereas the average net force acting on particles is zero under steady conditions, the mean, variance and asymmetry of the distribution of forces acting on particles vary with the momentum state of the particles. Numerical simulations of particle motions that are faithful to these statistical properties reproduce key empirical results, namely, the exponential-like velocity distribution and the nonlinear relation between hop distances and travel times. The simulations also illustrate how steady gradients in particle activity, the solid volume of particles in motion per unit streambed area, induce a diffusive flux as described in companion papers.},

His formulation of the relationship between rates of bed-sediment transport (especially bedload transport) and water flow comprised an innovative departure from the largely empirical approach that prevailed at the time. He introduced into that relationship the emerging fluid-mechanic concepts of turbulence and boundary layers, and concepts of probability theory. Inevitably the numerous complexities attending sediment transport mire formulation and prompt his use of several approximating compromises in order to make estimating bed-sediment transport practicable.

abstract = {Based on the mechanics of the Euler equation at short time, we show that a Recent Fluid Deformation (RFD) closure for the vorticity field, neglecting the early stage of advection of fluid particles, allows to build a 3D incompressible velocity field that shares many properties with empirical turbulence, such as the teardrop shape of the R-Q plane. Unfortunately, non gaussianity is weak (i.e. no intermittency) and vorticity gets preferentially aligned with the wrong eigenvector of the deformation. We then show that slightly modifying the former vectorial field in order to impose the long range correlated nature of turbulence allows to reproduce the main properties of stationary flows. Doing so, we end up with a realistic incompressible, skewed and intermittent velocity field that reproduces the main characteristics of 3D turbulence in the inertial range, including correct vorticity alignment properties.},

Our system is able to represent highly variable object classes and achieves state-of-the-art results in the PASCAL object detection challenges. While deformable part models have become quite popular, their value had not been demonstrated on difficult benchmarks such as the PASCAL datasets. Our system relies on new methods for discriminative training with partially labeled data. We combine a margin- sensitive approach for data-mining hard negative examples with a formalism we call latent SVM. A latent SVM is a reformulation of MI-SVM in terms of latent variables. A latent SVM is semi-convex and the training problem becomes convex once latent information is specified for the positive examples. This leads to an iterative training algorithm that alternates between fixing latent values for positive examples and optimizing the latent SVM objective function.},

abstract = {A minimal Lagrangian two-phase model to study turbulent bedload transport focus- ing on the granular phase is presented and validated with experiments. The model intends to describe bedload transport of massive particles in fully rough flows at relatively low Shields numbers, for which no suspension occurs. A discrete element method for the granular phase is coupled with a one dimensional volume-averaged two-phasemomentum equation for the fluid phase. The coupling between the discrete granular phase and the continuous fluid phase is discussed, and a consistent averaging formulation adapted to bedload transport is introduced. An original simple discrete random walk model is proposed to account for the fluid velocity fluctuations. The model is compared with experiments considering both classical sediment transport rate as a function of the Shields number, and depth profiles of solid velocity, volume fraction, and transport rate density, from existing bedload transport experiments in inclined flume. The results successfully reproduce the classical 3/2 power law, and more importantly describe well the depth profiles of the granular phase, showing that the model is able to reproduce the particle scale mechanisms. From a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that the fluctuation model allows to reproduce a realistic critical Shields number, and that the influence of the granular parameters on the macroscopic results is weak. Nevertheless, the analysis of the corresponding depth profiles reveals an evolution of the depth structure of the granular phase with varying restitution and friction coefficients, which denotes the non-trivial underlying physical mechanisms.},

abstract = {Rifflepool sequences are maintained through the preferential entrainment of sediment grains from pools rather than riffles. This preferential entrainment has been attributed to a reversal in the magnitude of velocity and shear stress under high flows; however the Differential Sediment Entrainment Hypothesis (DSEH) postulates that differential entrainment can instead result from spatial sedimentological contrasts. Here we use a novel suite of in situ grain-scale field measurements from a rifflepool sequence to parameterize a physically-based model of grain entrainment. Field measurements include pivoting angles, lift forces and high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) acquired using terrestrial laser scanning, from which particle exposure, protrusion and surface roughness were derived. The entrainment model results show that grains in pools have a lower critical entrainment shear stress than grains in either pool exits or riffles. This is because pool grains have looser packing, hence greater exposure and lower pivoting angles. Conversely, riffle and pool exit grains have denser packing, lower exposure and higher pivoting angles. A cohesive matrix further stabilizes pool exit grains. The resulting predictions of critical entrainment shear stress for grains in different subunits are compared with spatial patterns of bed shear stress derived from a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the reach. The CFD model predicts that, under bankfull conditions, pools experience lower shear stresses than riffles and pool exits. However, the difference in sediment entrainment shear stress is sufficiently large that sediment in pools is still more likely to be entrained than sediment in pool exits or riffles, resulting in differential entrainment under bankfull flows. Significantly, this differential entrainment does not require a reversal in flow velocities or shear stress, suggesting that sedimentological contrasts alone may be sufficient for the maintenance of rifflepool sequences. This finding has implications for the prediction of sediment transport and the morphological evolution of gravel-bed rivers. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {[1] Particles transported as bed load within a specified streambed area possess a distribution of velocities. This distribution figures prominently in describing the rate of sediment transport and the rate of dispersal of particles during transport. We provide a probabilistic derivation of the distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities under uniform, quasi-steady transport conditions. The formulation centers on defining the ensemble of microstates of particle momenta (the set of possible ways to partition a fixed number of particles into momentum states) subject to the constraint that the sum of the particle momenta in each microstate is fixed, a constraint that is imposed by conditions of equilibrium transport. From this, we obtain the most probable distribution of momentum states, assuming each microstate within the ensemble is equally probable. The analysis suggests that, for small particle numbers, the distribution of velocities is exponential-like but decays faster than an exponential function. For large particle numbers, the distribution is exponential. These distributions are consistent with experimental results from high-speed imaging of sand particles transported as bed load over a planar bed, which reveal that the probability distributions of streamwise and cross-stream particle velocities are exponential-like. These particle velocity distributions also emerge from numerical analyses involving large eddy simulations of turbulent fluid motions and a discrete element method describing particle motions, wherein the large eddy simulations and discrete element method models are fully coupled in momentum.},

abstract = {Shields (1936) found that the dimensionless shear stress necessary to move a cohesionless grain on a stream bed depended only on the grain Reynolds number. He ignored the degree of exposure of individual grains as a separate parameter. This report describes experiments to measure the dimensionless threshold stress and its dependence on grain protrusion, which was found to be very marked. The threshold stress for grains resting on the top of an otherwise flat bed in a turbulent stream was measured and found to be 0.01-considerably less than previously-reported values of 0.03-0.06 for beds where all grains were at the same level. It is suggested that the new lower value be used in all turbulent flow situations where the bed is of natural sediments or unlevelled material. An hypothesis is proposed that the conventional Shields diagram implicitly contains variation with protrusion between the two extremes of (i) large grains and large Reynolds numbers, with small relative protrusion, and (ii) small grains, low Reynolds numbers, and protrusion of almost a complete grain diameter. In view of this, the extent of the dip in the Shields plot is explicable in that it represents a transition between two different standards of levelling as well as the transition between laminar and turbulent flow past the grains, the range of which it overlaps considerably.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2018. American Geophysical Union. Sediment particles transported as bed load undergo alternating periods of motion and rest, particularly at weak flow intensity. Bed load transport can be investigated by either following the motion of individual particles (Lagrangian approach) or observing the phenomenon at prescribed locations (Eulerian approach). In this paper, the Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions are merged into a unifying framework that includes definitions for quantities used to describe the kinematics of particle motion, as well as the relationships among these quantities. The alternation of motion and rest is represented by two complementary descriptions: (i) proportion of motion, indicating either the relative time spent in motion by an individual particle or the relative number of moving particles; (ii) persistence of motion, indicating the extent to which the process consists of relatively few long periods of motion or of many short ones. The framework only involves first moments of the key quantities. The conceptual developments are tested against results from an experiment with weak bed load transport, demonstrating the soundness of the approach. From an operational point of view, a Lagrangian observation is difficult to perform, since the particle motion is usually investigated for finite spatial domains (e.g., a measurement window within a laboratory or natural reach). Strategies to overcome such limitations are described, suggesting the possibility of obtaining unbiased mean values for Lagrangian descriptors. The proposed framework can be used in any study aimed at parameterizing the kinematic properties of bed load particles as functions of the hydrodynamic conditions.},

abstract = {One significant facet of the disposal of radioactive wastes in alluvial streams pertains to the influence that natural sediments have on the transport and dispersion of radioactive wastes. The sorption of radioactive wastes by clay, silt, and sand (par ticularly clay-coated sand) is a common phenomenon; hence, the transport and dispersion of waste can be affected to a significant extent by the transport and dispersion of the individual sediment particles. To study the transport and dispersion of bed-material particles (sand), an experiment was conducted in the North Loup River near Purdum, Nebr. In the experiment, sand labeled with radioactive iridium 192 was released from a line source on the bed of the river. After release, the movement of the tracer particles downstream was observed by monitoring the streambed with a sled-mounted scintillation detector. In addition, the vertical distribution of the tracer particles in the bed was observed by monitoring core samples of the bed material. The amount of activity and the number of tracer particles used in the experiment were determined from detailed calibrations in which field conditions were simulated. The tracer particles varied within a fairly narrow range about a median fall diameter of 0.305 mm. The size of the tracer particles was selected so that they would be slightly coarser than the dominant size range of the bed material. Longitudinal traverses with the radiation detection equipment at approximately daily intervals and extending over a 13-day period defined the dispersion of tracer particles along the channel. The traverses also indicated that some of the tracer particles were buried as a concentrated deposit for about 7 days. Presumably, these tracer particles were deposited in an unusually deep dune trough and were not reexposed until a similarly deep trough passed by. The tem porary burial of the tracer particles demonstrates that deposits of contaminated particles in an alluvial stream can remain un disturbed for relatively long periods of time and then suddenly be released. A concentration-distribution function, which is based on probability theory, was derived to characterize the dispersion process. The parameters of the function are related to the dispersion time and distance. Significant characteristics of the function are that the variance and the mean of the distribution are proportional to time and that for large times the maximum concentration varies inversely with the square root of time. Comparable observed and theoretical distributions agreed well except near the origin and at the downstream tail. The explana tion for the differences is based on certain discrepancies betweenphysical features of the experiment and the corresponding assumptions on which the theoretical distribution function is based. The major discrepancy is that the theory applies only to a group of tracer particles having identical transport character istics, whereas the tracer particles did not all have the same characteristics. In addition to defining the dispersion of particles, the observed distribution curves provided information for computing the bed material discharge. The computation of discharge was made with a continuity-type equation, which states simply that the discharge is the product of the mean velocity of the particles and the cross-sectional area through which they move. Although a direct comparison of the computed discharge and a measured discharge could not be made, the computed discharge compared favorably with the discharge computed by the modified Einstein procedure. Although the concentration-distribution function was derived for the initial conditions of a vertical-plane source, it can be extended to more complex conditions by performing appropriate mathematical operations. In addition, the function can be applied to real situations if the constants in the concentration distribution function and the depth of the zone of particle movement in the bed are known. When the bed configuration consists of dunes or ripples, the depth of the zone of particle movement can be estimated from longitudinal profiles of the bed surface. However, until the relations between hydraulic and sediment parameters and the constants in the theoretical dis tribution function are defined, the constants can be evaluated only by experiment.},

abstract = {A variety of formulae has been developed to predict bed load transport in gravel bed rivers, ranging from simple regressions to complex multiparameter formulations. The ability to test these formulae across numerous field sites has, until recently, been hampered by a paucity of bed load transport data for gravel bed rivers. We use 2104 bed load transport observations in 24 gravel bed rivers in Idaho to assess the performance of eight different formulations of four bed load transport equations. Results show substantial differences in performance but no consistent relationship between formula performance and degree of calibration or complexity. However, formulae containing a transport threshold typically exhibit poor performance. Furthermore, we find that the transport data are best described by a simple power function of discharge. From this we propose a new bed load transport equation and identify channel and watershed characteristics that control the exponent and coefficient of the proposed power function. We find that the exponent is principally a factor of supply-related channel armoring (transport capacity in excess of sediment supply), whereas the coefficient is related to drainage area (a surrogate for absolute sediment supply). We evaluate the accuracy of the proposed power function at 17 independent test sites},

Starting from Einstein's theory, the approach was obtained by trying to overcome some of the intrinsic limitations.

The sediment transport rate is obtained by integrating the distribution of the ranges of the particle jumps multiplied by the average particle velocity. The relationship for the average ranges of particle jumps is an opportune combination of the Einstein and Yalin expressions. The final formulation was calibrated by means of a large number of experimental data and also by comparison with some of the most widely-used empirical formulas.

abstract = {An experimental investigation into the fluctuating pressure acting on sediment particles on the bed of an open-channel flow was carried out in a large laboratory flume for a range of flow depths and bed slopes. The pressure measurements were made using 23 spherical particles instrumented with differential pressure sensors. These measurements were complemented with simultaneous measurements of the velocity field using high-resolution stereoscopic particle image velocimetry. The pressure statistics show that the standard deviations of the drag and lift fluctuations vary from 2.0 to 2.6 and from 2.5 to 3.4 times the wall shear stress, respectively, and are dependent on relative submergence and flow Reynolds number. The skewness is positive for the drag fluctuations and negative for the lift fluctuations. The kurtosis values of both drag and lift fluctuations increase with particle submergence. The two-particle correlation between drag and lift fluctuations is found to be relatively weak compared to the two-point drag–drag and lift–lift correlations. The pressure cross-correlations between particles separated in the longitudinal direction exhibit maxima at certain time delays corresponding to the convection velocities varying from 0.64 to 0.72 times the bulk flow velocity, being very close to the near-bed eddy convection velocities. The temporal autocorrelation of drag fluctuations decays much faster than that for the lift fluctuations; as a result, the temporal scales of lift fluctuations are 3–6 times that of drag fluctuations. The spatial and temporal scales of both drag and lift fluctuations show dependence on flow depth and bed slope. The spectral behaviour of both drag and lift fluctuations is also assessed.

abstract = {Understanding bed load transport fluctuations in rivers is crucial for development of a transport theory and for choosing a sampling interval for "mean'' transport rates. Field-scale studies lack sufficient resolution to statistically characterize these fluctuations, while laboratory experiments are limited in scale and hence cannot be directly compared to field cases. Here we use a natural-scale laboratory channel to examine bed load transport fluctuations in a heterogeneous gravel substrate under normal flow conditions. The novelty of our approach is the application of a geometrical/statistical formalism (called the multifractal formalism), which allows characterization of the "roughness'' of the series (depicting the average strength of local abrupt fluctuations in the signal) and the "intermittency'' (depicting the temporal heterogeneity of fluctuations of different strength). We document a rougher and more intermittent behavior in bed load sediment transport series at low-discharge conditions, transitioning to a smoother and less intermittent behavior at high-discharge conditions. We derive an expression for the dependence of the probability distribution of bed load sediment transport rates on sampling interval. Our findings are consistent with field observations demonstrating that mean bed load sediment transport rate decreases with sampling time at low-transport conditions and increases with sampling time at high-transport conditions. Simultaneous measurement of bed elevation suggests that the statistics of sediment transport fluctuations are related to the statistics of bed topography.},

Large bed load transport events are found to correspond to low-frequency positive pressure fluctuations. Episodic penetration of fluid into the bed increases the bed stress and moves grains.

abstract = {Despite several decades of investigations, accounting for the effect of the wide range of grain sizes composing the bed of rivers on bedload transport remains a challenging problem. We investigate this problem by studying experimentally the influence of grain size distribution on bedload transport in the simple configuration of a bimodal sediment bed composed of a mixture of 2 populations of quartz grains of sizes D-1 = 0.7 +/- 0.1 mm and D-2 = 2.2 +/- 0.4 mm, respectively. The experiments are carried out in a tilted rectangular flume inside which the sediment bed is sheared by a steady and spatially uniform turbulent flow. Using a high-speed video imaging system, we focus on the measurement of the average particle velocity and the surface density of moving particles, defined as the number of moving particles per unit surface of the bed. These two quantities are measured separately for each population of grains as a function of the dimensionless shear stress (or Shields number) and the fraction of the bed surface covered with small grains. We show that the average velocity and the surface density of moving particles obey the same equations as those reported by Lajeunesse et al. (2010) for a bed of homogeneous grain size. Once in motion, the grains follow therefore similar laws whether the bed is made of uniform sediment or of a bimodal mixture. This suggests that the erosion-deposition model established by Lajeunesse et al. (2010) for a bed of uniform sediment can be generalized to the case of a bimodal one. The only difference evidenced by our experiments concerns the critical Shields number for incipient sediment motion. Above a uniform sediment bed, the latter depends on the particle Reynolds number through the Shields curve. In the case of a bimodal bed, our experiments show that the critical Shields numbers of both populations of grains decrease linearly with the fraction of the bed surface covered with small grains. We propose a simple model to account for this observation.},

On the basis of micromechanical and fluid dynamical considerations, two separate criteria for the initiation of motion are derived: one for rolling and one for lifting. Fluid forces such as drag, shear lift, Magnus lift, and lift due to centrifugal force are included in the derivation. The formulation of the lift force is theoretical. No empirical coefficient is used other than the drag coefficient C d , which is well established in the literature. In the low particle Reynolds number regime, where u * d/$\nu$ ≤ 1, the dimensionless stress required to initiate lifting is found to be much higher than that of rolling, the former substantially above the Shields' curve while the latter is substantially below it. The theory is compared with Vanoni's 1964 data, with meaningful results. For higher particle Reynolds number, where u * d /$\nu${\textgreater} 10, the dimensionless stress needed to initiate lifting is closer to that of rolling. The Shields' curve for the most part lies between the two theoretical thresholds.},

abstract = {Estimates of sediment transport rates in gravel-bed rivers are typically developed from formulae or from a sampling campaign. The former are notoriously inaccurate; the latter require a large effort and may still not achieve acceptable accuracy. A wide range of geomorphological problems, particularly those at the watershed scale, could be addressed more accurately if reliable local estimates of transport rate could be incorporated routinely into such studies. This requires a method for estimating transport rate with acceptable accuracy and a minimum of effort. A consistent approach to estimating transport is not just a matter of which formula or sampler to use; a suitable approach requires a consistent and reliable scaling of the water discharge and an integral description of the sediment that is both meaningful and practical. An approach proposed here, using a few observations of small transport rates to calibrate a transport formula, is likely to provide a superior combination of accuracy and effort and substantially reduces flow-scaling error. Small transport rates can be measured effectively using pit samplers, which allow the sampling periods needed for accurate measurements. Grain size can be represented as two fractions, sand and gravel, which capture some of the important transport dynamics and effectively represent important environmental problems within a tractable methodological approach. The approach is nearly independent of the uncertainty associated with measuring slope and bed grain-size in the field.},

The equation can be applied to multiple size fractions and ensures smooth transition of sediment variables between bed load and suspended load for each size fraction.

abstract = {The role played by the texture of the sediment supply on channel bed adjustments in gravel- bed rivers is poorly understood. To address this issue, an experimental campaign has been designed. Flume experiments lasting 96 h in a 9 m long, 0.60 m wide have been performed with different sand-gravel mix- tures as feed textures. The response of the surface texture has been found to be highly dependent on the grain size distribution of the feed. When the feed texture included gravel, the finest fractions of the sedi- ment supply infiltrate beneath the surface. Conversely, sand remains on the surface when the feed texture lacks gravel. This different textural response becomes obscured when water discharge increases. Further, the sediment transport rate approaches the feed rate differently depending on the content of gravel in the feed texture. When a small proportion of gravel is part of the feed texture, bed load transport rate asymp- totically approaches the feed rate. However, when a significant fraction of gravel is part of the feed grain size distribution, bed load transport rate approaches the feed rate by following an oscillatory path. These findings have been verified in terms of a one-dimensional numerical model. This modeling reveals that the higher the differences in mobility among the grain sizes contained in the feed texture, the more evident is the nonasymptotic transient trend toward equilibrium},

abstract = {A two-dimensional simulation model of travel distances of individual particles in a gravel-bed river is presented. The model is based on a number of rules, which include particle size, entrainment, trajectory, distance of movement and entrapment. Particle interactions are controlled by resistance fields defined about each obstacle and critical elevation defined in the model. Resistance fields, particle dropping and critical elevation rules control particle interactions. The interaction rules cause the particles to develop pebble clusters, stone cells and transverse structures (transverse ribs). The simulated travel distances of individual particles are consistent with reported field results. Individual particle travel distances were simulated using two different models; one without interactions between the individual particles and the stationary bed and one with interactions. The case without interactions demonstrates the random nature of sediment transport, and narrow ranges of travel distances. Wider ranges of travel distances, similar to those for natural situations, were obtained for the cases with interactions. The more intense the interaction between the mobile stones and the stationary ones, the wider the range of distances of travel for a given particle size. Modelling the mean travel distance yielded a result similar to that published previously, which was based on empirical data. Well developed bed-surface structures were obtained for relatively poorly sorted sediment with intense interactions between particles. Transverse structures developed when relatively large particles were allowed to move.},

abstract = {The beds of gravel-bed rivers commonly display distinct sorting patterns, which at length scales of {\~{}}. 0.1. 1 channel widths appear to form an organization of patches or facies. This paper explores alternatives to traditional visual facies mapping by investigating methods of patch delineation in which clustering analysis is applied to a high-resolution grid of spatial grain-size distributions (GSDs) collected during a flume experiment. Specifically, we examine four clustering techniques: 1) partitional clustering of grain-size distributions with the k-means algorithm (assigning each GSD to a type of patch based solely on its distribution characteristics), 2) spatially-constrained agglomerative clustering ("growing" patches by merging adjacent GSDs, thus generating a hierarchical structure of patchiness), 3) spectral clustering using Normalized Cuts (using the spatial distance between GSDs and the distribution characteristics to generate a matrix describing the similarity between all GSDs, and using the eigenvalues of this matrix to divide the bed into patches), and 4) fuzzy clustering with the fuzzy c-means algorithm (assigning each GSD a membership probability to every patch type). For each clustering method, we calculate metrics describing how well-separated cluster-average GSDs are and how patches are arranged in space. We use these metrics to compute optimal clustering parameters, to compare the clustering methods against each other, and to compare clustering results with patches mapped visually during the flume experiment.All clustering methods produced better-separated patch GSDs than the visually-delineated patches. Although they do not produce crisp cluster assignment, fuzzy algorithms provide useful information that can characterize the uncertainty of a location on the bed belonging to any particular type of patch, and they can be used to characterize zones of transition from one patch to another. The extent to which spatial information influences clustering leads to a trade-off between the quality of GSD separation between patch types and the spatial coherence of patches. Methods incorporating spatial information during the clustering process tended to produce a finite number of types of patches. As methods improve for collecting high-resolution grain size data, the approaches described here can be scaled up to field studies to better characterize the grain size heterogeneity of river beds. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this work we incorporate the effect of near-bed coherent flow structures into the entrainment of randomly configured mixed-size sediments. The fourth-order Gram–Charlier type probability density function (GC pdf) of near-bed streamwise velocity is employed to account for the higher-order correlations associated with turbulent bursting. A compilation of the published data over a wide range of bed roughness is used to analyze the near-bed coherent flow structures, including the second-, third-, and fourth-order moments of velocity fluctuation (i.e., turbulence intensity, skewness, and flatness factors) required in the fourth-order GC pdf. An important result of this study is a set of quantitative relations used to predict these higher-order moments as a function of the roughness Reynolds number. The random grain protrusion is parameterized with the exposure and friction heights, and an existing probabilistic approach is used to correct the hiding effect of mixed-size sediment. The above factors are all incorporated into the formulation of entrainment (rolling and lifting) probabilities. As compared to the previous normal and lognormal models, the present results demonstrate significantly improved agreement with the observed data for the unisize and mixed-size sediments under partial- and full-transport conditions. The results also reveal that the third-order GC pdf can be used to approximate the fourth-order one for the fully rough beds, however, for smooth beds the fourth-order GC pdf should be used to adequately incorporate the effects of higher-order correlations. This paper offers some new insights into the processes of sediment entrainment.},

abstract = {The pioneering predictor of fluvial bed-load transport rate proposed by Meyer-Peter and Moller in 1948 is still extensively used in basic research and engineering applications. A review of the basis for its formulation reveals, however, that an unnecessary bed roughness correction was applied to cases of plane-bed morphodynamic equilibrium. Its inclusion followed a flow resistance parameterization in tenus of the Nikuradse roughness height, which has been shown (well after the publication of their work) to be inappropriate for the characterization of mobile bed rough conditions in rivers. Removing the unnecessary correction and incorporating an improved correction of the boundary shear stress due to sidewall effects allow elucidation of the most parsimonious form of the bed-load relation of Meyer-Peter and Moller that is dictated by their own data set. The new predictor is presented in terms of two alternative power law forms. These amended forms show that, in the case of lower-regime plane-bed equilibrium transport of uniform bed sediment, the new estimates of volume bed-load transport rates are less than or equal to half the values that would be obtained with the original relation of Meyer-Peter and Moller in the absence of the unnecessary bed roughness correction. The meticulous database and clear analysis of the original work of Meyer-Peter and Moller greatly aided the present writers in their reanalysis, which liberally uses the hindsight offered by 58 years of subsequent research.},

To generate a packing of 2D dense sample in a container of arbitrary shape, a number of key particle properties are identified as the targeted ones to reproduce, including the grain size distribution, density, particles orientations as well as specific shape characteristics of the particles. Four descriptors, including elongation, circularity, roundness, regularity, are chosen to characterize the particle shape. The considered container is discretized by a Voronoi tessellation with prescribed cell size and orientation distributions. Each Voronoi cell is then filledwith a particle with prescribed shape characteristics. Several algorithms are proposed and are compared in terms of their computational efficiency and accuracy to define the particle contours, to constrain the Voronoi tessellation and to fill the Voronoi cells with particles. Two examples are further employed to demonstrate the accuracy and the potential usefulness of the proposed method for a wide range of applications where discrete modelling of granular media is important. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

The observation that many transport systems exhibit apparent scale-dependent behavior$\backslash$n and non-Fickian dispersion suggests that this assumption is not always valid. We revisit a nearly 50 year old tracer experiment$\backslash$n in which the tracer plume exhibits the hallmarks of dispersive transport described by a step length distribution with a divergent$\backslash$n second moment and no characteristic dispersive size. The governing equation of this type of random walk contains fractional-order$\backslash$n derivatives.

The first version uses a heavy-tailed particle step length distribution with a divergent second moment to$\backslash$n reproduce the anomalously high fraction of tracer mass observed in the downstream tail of the spatial distribution. The second$\backslash$n version adds a feature that partitions mass into a detectable mobile phase and an undetectable, immobile phase. This two-phase$\backslash$n transport model predicts other features observed in the data: a decrease in the amount of detected tracer mass over the course$\backslash$n of the experiment and enhanced particle retention near the source.

abstract = {In this work, a fully-coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and Discrete Element Method (DEM) are used to simulate a unidirectional turbulent open-channel flow over the full range of sediment transport regimes. The fluid and particles are computed on separate grids using a dual-grid formulation to maintain consistency and avoid instability issues. The results of coupling the dispersed phase to a multiphase flow solver that uses volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations are compared to those obtained from coupling through drag to a single flow solver. The current work also examines the applicability and limitations of lumping particles as a representative particle to reduce the cost of simulations. Insight to the impact of different turbulent events to the entrainment of particles is also given. The simulation results of sediment transport from both coupling techniques show good agreement with empirical formulas in the bedload regime, but under-predict sediment transport in the suspended load regime. In the suspended load regime, using partial coupling, the rate of sediment transport was found to be under-predicted as compared to full-coupling. The deviation in results in the suspended load regime was found to increase with increases in the applied shear stress. Both coupling methods revealed the same effect on the friction factor where friction increases in the bedload regime and decreases in the suspended load regime reaching a maximum at the transition between regimes. This result is contrary to past studies which have shown a discrete jump in the friction factor at the transition. Lumping particles as representative particles is shown to reduce the simulation cost by more than a factor of 5 when using a scaling factor of 2. By doing a quadrant analysis on information obtained from particle and flow field results, it was found that most of the particles are entrained by more frequent sweep events.},

In the numerical simulations of dune fields, we observe the formation and the evolution of superimposed bed forms on barchan and transverse dunes. Using the same model under different initial conditions, we perform the linear stability analysis of a flat sand bed disturbed by a small sinusoidal perturbation. Comparing the most unstable wavelength in the model with the characteristic size of secondary bed forms in nature, we determine the length and time scales of our cellular automaton model.

The cornerstone of the proposed model is based on the concept that the particle motion is governed by the intermittent nature of near-bed turbulence. Based on this mechanism, in this article we provide a quantitative model for predicting the commencement of sediment entrainment for the first time under three representative bed packing densities corresponding to the isolated, wake interference, and skimming flow regimes.

abstract = {Characterizing the collective behavior of particle transport on the Earth surface is a key ingredient in describing landscape evolution. We seek equations that capture essential features of transport of an ensemble of particles on hillslopes, valleys, river channels, or river networks, such as mass conservation, superdiffusive spreading in flow fields with large velocity variation, or retardation due to particle trapping. Development of stochastic partial differential equations such as the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) begins with assumptions about the random behavior of a single particle: possible velocities it may experience in a flow field and the length of time it may be immobilized. When assumptions underlying the ADE are relaxed, a fractional ADE (fADE) can arise, with a non-integer-order derivative on time or space terms. Fractional ADEs are nonlocal; they describe transport affected by hydraulic conditions at a distance. Space fractional ADEs arise when velocity variations are heavy tailed and describe particle motion that accounts for variation in the flow field over the entire system. Time fractional ADEs arise as a result of power law particle residence time distributions and describe particle motion with memory in time. Here we present a phenomenological discussion of how particle transport behavior may be parsimoniously described by a fADE, consistent with evidence of superdiffusive and subdiffusive behavior in natural and experimental systems.},

Granular materials exhibit complicated mechanical behaviors, which are affected significantly by the irregular shape of particles. Currently, the discrete element method (DEM) has been accepted as an effective approach to investigate the mechanical behaviors of granular materials. However, there are scarce simulations based on DEM in literatures considering the irregularity of particle shape. A new method is proposed to simulate individual real particle with irregular shape using clump constituted by overlapping spheres. First, the geometric model of real particle with surface nodes and inner nodes is established through digitally processing the computerized tomography (CT) scanning data. Second, a clump consisting of spheres is generated to simulate the real particle using a minimum distance criterion. The criterion is implemented by tree optimization algorithm. Influential factors are also introduced to balance the model accuracy and computing cost. Effects of the influential factors, including the density of geometric grid and the minimum distance, on simulations are discussed. Results show that this new method is simpler and more efficient than the previous methods in terms of the model accuracy and computing cost.},

abstract = {In this work, we developed a method to decipher the shape message imprinted in single sediment particles, a method that would reflect the detail information of surface morphology. It uses 2D mathematical descriptions to restore and characterize 3D shape and surface morphology of sediment particles in terms of the "mathematical sediment", so as to better understand 3D geometric characteristics reflected by single sediment particles. To prevent the simplification of morphology description and overcome the deficiencies of lower-dimensional characteristics, we proposed a concept of "mathematical sediment" in this paper. The mathematical sediment uses image analysis of scanning electron microscope photographs and complex Fourier shape analysis to describe the planar projection shape of sediment particles and further restore the 3D morphology of sediment particles through a certain combination ways. The shapes of sediment particles are controlled using Fourier coefficients to generate a variety of mathematical sediments with various shapes, which allow the realization of the description and analysis of the 3D morphology of sediment particles. The fractal theory is further used to verify the rationality of mathematical sediment. Compared with the traditional method, the mathematical sediment overcomes the lack of particle system and smooth sphere systems and can reproduce 3D irregular surfaces for the morphology analysis. The rationality verification showed that the complex surface morphology of mathematical sediment is basically similar to the surface morphology of natural sediment. The mathematical sediment can reflect the true surface characteristics of sediment particles. The characteristics of shape properties and surface morphology it conveys are consistent with the natural sediment and can be used as a research basis for the further study both in fresh water and marine.},

abstract = {A high-speed video system was used to study the interaction between sediment particles and turbulence in the wall region of an open channel flow with both smooth and transitionally rough beds. In smooth flows, particles immersed within the viscous sublayer were seen to accumulate along low-speed wall streaks; apparently due to the presence of quasi-streamwise vortices in the wall region. Larger particles did not tend to group along streaks, however their velocity was observed to respond to the streaky structure of the flow velocity in the wall region. In transitionally rough flows particle sorting was not observed. Coherent flow structures in the form of shear layers typically observed in the near-wall region interacted with sediment particles lying on the channel bottom, resulting in the particles being entrained into suspension. Although there has been some speculation that this process would not be effective in entraining particles totally immersed in the viscous sublayer, the results obtained demonstrate the opposite. The entrainment mechanism appears to be the same independent of the roughness condition of the bottom wall, smooth or transitionally rough. In the latter case, however, hiding effects tend to preclude the entrainment of particles with sizes finer than that of the roughness elements. The analysis of particle velocity during entrainment shows that the streamwise component tends to be much smaller than the local mean flow velocity, while the vertical component tends to be much larger than the local standard deviation of the vertical flow velocity fluctuations, which would indicate that such particles are responding to rather extreme flow ejection events.},

Three sets of measurements with acoustic Doppler velocimeters in an irrigation canal were used: two with subcritical bed shear stress (static beds) and one with the bed shear stress ?o close to critical ?oc (weakly mobile bed). The analyses included vertical distributions of local mean velocities, turbulence intensities, turbulent shear stresses, velocity auto- and cross-spectra, the quadrant method, and high-order velocity moments. A number of properties of turbulence intensities, high-order moments, streamwise bursting parameters, and velocity spectra appeared to be similar for all three flows, but some properties were different. The most important one was an observed reduction in the von Ka ´rma ´n constant for the flow with weakly mobile bed. Comparison of these results with other studies and analogies with drag-reducing flows suggest that at ?o /?oc ? 1 the drag on the bed for a given granular material should be minimized.},

Previous investigations of the hydraulic conditions required to entrain coarse riverbed material have reported critical shear stress values ranging from 0.25 to 0.020 for a given particle size. This analysis indicates that virtually all of the variation is due to differences in the subsurface bed-material size distribution. This analysis shows that [IMG]f2.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}*ci varies almost inversely proportional to the particle diameter for a nonuniform bed material; therefore, bed particles between 0.3 to 4.2 times [IMG]f1.gif" ALT="d" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}50 are entrained at nearly the same discharge. An investigation of the hydraulic characteristics and bed-material mobility of 24 self-formed gravel-bed rivers in Colorado determined that particles as large as the median diameter of the bed surface were entrained by discharges equal to the bankfull stage or less. Particles as large as the 90th-percentile fraction were entrained by the bankfull discharge in nine of the rivers studied. Consequently, in these rivers, a significant fraction of the riverbed was entrained rather frequently over a period of years, although the transport rate was very small.},

abstract = {The behaviour of granular material in motion is studied from a continuum point of view. Insofar as possible, individual grains are treated as the ‘molecules' of a granular ‘fluid'. Besides the obvious contrast in shape, size and mass, a key difference between true molecules and grains is that collisions of the latter are inevitably inelastic. This, together with the fact that the fluctuation velocity may be comparable to the flow velocity, necessitates explicit incorporation of the energy equation, in addition to the continuity and momentum equations, into the theoretical description. Simple ‘microscopic' kinetic models are invoked for deriving expressions for the ‘coefficients' of viscosity, thermal diffusivity and energy absorption due to collisions. The ‘coefficients' are not constants, but are functions of the local state of the medium, and therefore depend on the local ‘temperature' and density. In general the resulting equations are nonlinear and coupled. However, in the limit s [double less-than sign] d, where s is the mean separation between neighbouring grain surfaces and d is a grain diameter, the above equations become linear and can be solved analytically. An important dependent variable, in this formulation, in addition to the flow velocity u, is the mean random fluctuation (‘thermal') velocity {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} of an individual grain. With a sufficient flux of energy supplied to the system through the boundaries of the container, {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} can remain non-zero even in the absence of flow. The existence of a non-uniform {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} is the means by which energy can be ‘conducted' from one part of the system to another. Because grain collisions are inelastic, there is a natural (damping) lengthscale, governed by the value of d, which strongly influences the functional dependence of {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} on position. Several illustrative examples of static (u = 0) systems are solved. As an example of grain flow, various Couette-type problems are solved analytically. The pressure, shear stress, and ‘thermal' velocity function {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} are all determined by the relative plate velocity U (and the boundary conditions). If {\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}}{\$} is set equal to zero at both plates, the pressure and stress are both proportional to U2, i.e. the fluid is non-Newtonian. However, if sufficient energy is supplied externally through the walls ({\$}\backslashoverline{\{}v{\}} \backslashne 0{\$} there), then the forces become proportional to the first power of U. Some examples of Couette flow are given which emphasize the large effect on the grain system properties of even a tiny amount of inelasticity in grain–grain collisions. From these calculations it is suggested that, for the case of Couette flow, the flow of sand is supersonic over most of the region between the confining plates.},

abstract = {Understanding bed load transport fluctuations in rivers is crucial for development of a transport theory and for choosing a sampling interval for "mean'' transport rates. Field-scale studies lack sufficient resolution to statistically characterize these fluctuations, while laboratory experiments are limited in scale and hence cannot be directly compared to field cases. Here we use a natural-scale laboratory channel to examine bed load transport fluctuations in a heterogeneous gravel substrate under normal flow conditions. The novelty of our approach is the application of a geometrical/statistical formalism (called the multifractal formalism), which allows characterization of the "roughness'' of the series (depicting the average strength of local abrupt fluctuations in the signal) and the "intermittency'' (depicting the temporal heterogeneity of fluctuations of different strength). We document a rougher and more intermittent behavior in bed load sediment transport series at low-discharge conditions, transitioning to a smoother and less intermittent behavior at high-discharge conditions. We derive an expression for the dependence of the probability distribution of bed load sediment transport rates on sampling interval. Our findings are consistent with field observations demonstrating that mean bed load sediment transport rate decreases with sampling time at low-transport conditions and increases with sampling time at high-transport conditions. Simultaneous measurement of bed elevation suggests that the statistics of sediment transport fluctuations are related to the statistics of bed topography.},

abstract = {[1] Steep slope streams show large fluctuations of sediment discharge across several time scales. These fluctuations may be inherent to the internal dynamics of the sediment transport process. A probabilistic framework thus seems appropriate to analyze such a process. In this paper, we present an experimental study of bedload transport over a steep slope flume for small to moderate Shields numbers. The sampling technique allows the acquisition of high‐ resolution time series of the solid discharge. The resolved time scales range from 10 −1 s up to 10 5 s. We show that two distinct time scales can be observed in the probability density function for the waiting time between moving particles. We make the point that the separation of time scales is related to collective dynamics. Proper statistics of a Markov process including collective entrainment are derived. The separation of time scales is recovered theoretically for low entrainment rates. Citation: Heyman, J., F. Mettra, H. B. Ma, and C.

It must incorporate a strategy for avoiding irreversible or large-scale environmental mistakes that arise from social and political forces that tend to promote fragmented, uncritical, short-sighted, inflexible, and overly optimistic assessments of resource status, management capabilities, and the consequences of decisions and policies. Aquatic resources are vulnerable to the effects of human activities catchment-wide, and many of the landscape changes humans routinely induce cause irreversible damage (e.g., some species introductions, extinctions of ecotypes and species) or give rise to cumulative, long-term, large-scale biological and cultural consequences (e.g., accelerated erosion and sedimentation, deforestation, toxic contamination of sediments). In aquatic ecosystems, biotic impoverishment and environmental disruption caused by past management and natural events profoundly constrain the ability of future management to maintain biodiversity and restore historical ecosystem functions and values. To provide for rational, adaptive progress in ecosystem management and to reduce the risk of irreversible and unanticipated consequences, managers and scientists must identify catchments and aquatic networks where ecological integrity has been least damaged by prior management, and jointly develop means to ensure their protection as reservoirs of natural biodiversity, keystones for regional restoration, management models, monitoring benchmarks, and resources for ecological research.},

The structure of the mixture is further analyzed in terms of contact types, and the mean coordination number is demonstrated to be primarily affected by "large-small" contacts. A novel method for estimating the average relative excluded volume for binary spheres by weighting the percentages of contact types is proposed and extended to polydisperse packings of certain size distributions.

abstract = {Diffusion models have been widely applied to describe fluvial long profiles. However, aggrading rivers simulated in laboratory experiments typically display much less profile curvature than a diffusion model would predict, whether aggradation is driven by subsidence or by base-level rise. Here we explore the possibility that this is due to nonclassical or non-Fickian, anomalous sediment transport in braided networks, which are known to have fractal planform geometry. We solve a fractional diffusion equation for a steady state aggrading fluvial profile for fractional exponents in the spatial derivative a in the range 1.1 {\textless} a + 1 {\textless} 2. The domain is bounded at both ends, and a constant sediment sink forces extraction of all of the imposed, constant sediment supply. We assume the fractional behavior is expressed solely by a nonlocal sediment flux term. Using the right-hand Caputo fractional derivative, we are able to construct a fractional diffusion equation that admits an analytical fluvial profile closely matching the laboratory-scale physical observations. We show that this solution is also in good agreement with a Monte Carlo simulation obtained using step lengths drawn from a L{\'{e}}vy probability density. However, despite the clear nonlocal behavior, we are unable to establish a direct physical link between the power law statistics of the fluvial transport system and the mathematical ingredients in a fractional diffusion model. In general, we expect the fractional behavior to be most pronounced when the length scale of significant downstream sediment extraction is comparable to the scale range of the fractal channel pattern behavior. This is typically the case for laboratory experiments but not at field scales, which could explain why anomalously flat fluvial long profiles have not been reported from the field. Applying fractional calculus to depositional river profiles, at any scale, exposes problems in applying fractional calculus posed by the bounded domain and the presence of a distributed sink associated with sediment extraction. With present understanding, the benefit of fractional calculus, which is its ability to capture effects of power law statistics in the underlying dynamics, comes at a significant cost in terms of flexibility to handle other physical effects such as complex domains, boundary conditions, and source terms.},

Contradicting the classic view that $\kappa$ should be universal in open-channel flows of clear water with a fully developed boundary layer, irrespectively of the type of boundary, it has recently been proposed that the value of $\kappa$ is influenced by the mobility of the bottom boundary.Rather than advocating a particular view on the nature of $\kappa$, the objectives of this work are: (i) to provide a similarity framework for the nature of $\kappa$, highlighting, in the process, the underlying key phenomena at play, and (ii) to explore a theoretical model for $\kappa$ as a function of turbulence parameters.Dimensional analysis is performed, including a new key step, following the works of Selim Yalin, in which the shear-rate is interpreted as a two-phase variable, depending on flow as well as sediment parameters. Vaschy-Buckingham's theorem is applied and similarity arguments leading to the log-law are employed. These introduce appropriate hypothesis concerning complete and incomplete similarity, thus providing a theoretical framework for the discussion of the nature of $\kappa$. A theoretical model is then explored, materialised in a functional relation between $\kappa$ and turbulence parameters. The discussion of the nature of $\kappa$ becomes a discussion of the nature of those parameters, all susceptible to be measured. Such discussion is based on laboratory results concerning flows over porous immobile and mobile beds. The data reveals changes in the structure of turbulence for flows over weakly mobile gravel-sand beds but is not supportive of a reduction of the value of $\kappa$.},

abstract = {Temporary storage of sediment within alluvial valley floors modulates the long-term transport of sediment through landscapes. The fate of weathering minerals or sediment-bound constituents in fluvial environments depends on the relative time scales of constituent degradation and particle residence time within valleys. Particles follow a set of trajectories through valley floors: some particles pass directly through the channel, reaching the basin outlet rapidly after being introduced to the fluvial system; others remain for long periods in deposits such as flood plains. Traditional sediment routing theory, based on the principle of sediment mass conservation along reaches of channel, does not account for exchanges of sediment with temporary sediment storage reservoirs outside the channel, such as flood plains, deltas, and alluvial fans. This article formalizes a theory that incorporates the role of such exchanges in the migration of sediment through river systems, by computing the probabilistic structure of particle trajectories through alluvial valley floors. Equations are developed for computing these trajectories from the sediment budget of a valley floor in steady state. Mathematical strategies for using such relationships to model transient storage conditions are proposed, and other potential model enhancements are discussed. The approach is illustrated using a hypothetical valley floor as an example. The theory can be used to examine rates of sediment overturn in valleys, map particle residence times, and account for the redistribution and decomposition of weathering minerals and particle-bound constituents. The theory has numerous potential management applications, some of which are discussed herein. The hypothetical example demonstrates that the probability distribution of particle residence times in the valleys of most alluvial rivers should be strongly right skewed.

We underline the multiscale aspect of wall turbulence, which has challenged scientists to devise simple theoretical models adequate to fit experimental data, and we show that a sound rendering of wall turbulence mechanisms is required to produce a physical understanding of particle deposition and re-entrainment. This physical understanding can be implemented in more applied simulation techniques, such as Large-Eddy Simulation. Our arguments are based also on the phenomenology of coherent structures and on the examination of flow topology in connection with particle preferential distribution. Starting from these concepts, reasons why theoretical predictions may fail are examined together with the requirements which must be fulfilled by suitable predictive models. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {With the 4th ITI conference in the beautiful ancient town of Bertinoro, North Italy, 2010, the tradition of the interdisciplinary turbulence initiative (ITI) has been con- tinued. About 100 researchers from about 20 different countries gathered in the hospitable centre of the University of Bologna to present the latest contributions in turbulence research. After an external peer review process the present 63 papers were collected for this forth issue on “progress in turbulence” dedicated to the mem- ory of Prof. Tim Nickels. Shortly after giving an invited lecture at the 4th ITI con- ference, the turbulence community lost a world-class scientist, a friend and devoted family man. Basic as well as applied research is driven by the rather notorious difficult and essentially unsolved problem of turbulence. In this collection of contributions clear progress can be seen in different aspects, ranging from new quality of numerical simulations to new concepts of experimental investigations and new theoretical de- velopments. The importance of turbulence is shown for a wide range of applications including: combustion, energy, flow control, urban flows, are few examples found in this volume. A motivation this year was to bring fundamentals of turbulence in connectionwith renewable energy. This lead us to add a special topic relevant to the impact of turbulence on the wind energy conversion. Beside all progress we have to realize that a general fundamental understanding of turbulence is still missing, even though new approaches are discovered and in- vestigated. These new approaches often lead to new methods, which result in being very useful for other disciplines. Thus turbulence research has been a source of new scientific fields over the last decades. Nonlinear dynamics, chaos research, fractals and complexity may be taken as examples. This span of research from pure mathematical analysis over turbulence physics to applied turbulence research has lead in the last decades to a broad diversification of turbulence research where contact between different sub-communities has some- times been lost. Itwas in particular the latter drifting apart in the community that has been the stimulation of the interdisciplinary turbulence initiative, which started in 1999 as cooperation between physicists and engineersworking in turbulence funded by the German science foundation DFG. Based on the successful previous confer- ences, we will continue with this initiative for subsequent years with the 5th ITI Conference planned for September 2012. The structure of the present book is as such that contributions have been bun- dled according to covering topics i.e. I Basic Turbulence Aspects, II Particle Laden Flows, III Modeling and Simulations, IV, Experimental Methods, V Special Flows, VI Atmospheric Boundary Layer, VII Boundary Layer, VIII Wind Energy and IX Convection. At this point we would like to thank all authors for their contributions to this proceedings and the referees giving critical comments to the contributions and there with considerably raising the scientific quality. We would like to thank Thomas Ditzinger from Springer for his patience during the production of the book. Finally we gratefully acknowledge the staff of the University of Bologna and Olga Kelbin, George Khujadze, Andreas Rosteck for helping us to carry out this conference.},

@article{Chiodi2014,
abstract = {The transport of dense particles by a turbulent flow depends on two dimensionless numbers. Depending on the ratio of the shear velocity of the flow to the settling velocity of the particles (or the Rouse number), sediment transport takes place in a thin layer localized at the surface of the sediment bed (bedload) or over the whole water depth (suspended load). Moreover, depending on the sedimentation Reynolds number, the bedload layer is embedded in the viscous sublayer or is larger. We propose here a two-phase flow model able to describe both viscous and turbulent shear flows. Particle migration is described as resulting from normal stresses, but is limited by turbulent mixing and shear-induced diffusion of particles. Using this framework, we theoretically investigate the transition between bedload and suspended load.},

abstract = {Ideas deriving from the standard formulation for continuous time random walk (CTRW) based on the Montroll-Weiss Master Equation (ME) have been recently applied to transport and diffusion of river tracer pebbles. CTRW, accompanied by appropriate probability density functions (PDFs) for walker step length and waiting time, yields asymptotically the standard advection-diffusion equation (ADE) for thin-tailed PDFs and the fractional advection-diffusion equation (fADE) for heavy-tailed PDFs, the latter allowing the possibilities of subdiffusion or superdiffusion. Here we show that the CTRW ME is inappropriate for river pebbles moving as bed load: a deposited particle raises local bed elevation, and an entrained particle lowers it so that particles interact with the lattice of the sediment-water interface. We use the Parker-Paola-Leclair framework, which is a probabilistic formulation of the Exner equation of sediment conservation, to develop a new ME for tracer transport and dispersion for alluvial morphodynamics. The formulation is based on the existence of a mean bed elevation averaged over fluctuations. The new ME yields asymptotic forms for ADE and fADE that differ significantly from CTRW. It allows vertical as well as streamwise advection-diffusion. Vertical dispersion is nonlocal but cannot be expressed with fractional derivatives. In order to illustrate the new model, we apply it to the restricted case of vertical dispersion only, with both thin and heavy tails for relevant PDFs. Vertical dispersion shows a subdiffusive behavior.},

abstract = {The fluvial riparian and aquatic patch mosaic varies along rivers according to geomorphological setting, hydrological regime, sediment supply and surface-groundwater connectivity. This relation between physical processes and plants is not unidirectional. Once established, riparian and aquatic plants frequently act as physical ecosystem engineers by trapping and stabilising sediments, organic matter and the propagules of other plant species, modifying the local sedimentary and morphological environment by driving the development of landforms and associated habitats, and so facilitating the rapid establishment of other plants that can in turn reinforce the development of landforms such as river banks, vegetated islands and floodplains. This paper reviews knowledge on the hydrogeomorphological significance of riparian and aquatic vegetation with a particular emphasis on humid temperate, mixed load, gravel bed, floodplain rivers.First, we investigate how vegetation dynamics across river margins are governed by hydrological processes that can both promote riparian vegetation growth and disturb and destroy riparian and aquatic vegetation. We show, with some simple numerical modeling, that different combinations of moisture supply and flow disturbance have the potential to generate many different responses in the lateral distribution of vegetation biomass along river corridors.Second, building on the varied lateral biomass distributions that are primarily dictated by hydrological processes, we review research evaluating characteristic vegetation-mediated landform development. We investigate aquatic and riparian plants acting as physical ecosystem engineers by creating and modifying habitats in river systems with sufficient suspended sediment supply for habitat or landform building. These plants have a crucial impact on sediment stabilisation and pioneer landform building along the interface between plant (resistance) dominated and fluvial-disturbance (force) dominated zones of the river corridor. We present some examples of vegetation-mediated landforms along rivers with strongly contrasting hydrological regimes and thus lateral distributions of vegetation.Lastly, we present a conceptual synthetic model that links the development of pioneer landforms by engineering plants with river morphology and morphodynamics in humid temperate, mixed load, gravel bed, floodplain rivers. Drawing on four example rivers, we show how different plants and pioneer landforms act at the interface between the plant dominated and fluvial-disturbance dominated zones of the river corridor as river energy and vegetation colonisation and growth change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Stable reticulate structures, which we call “stone cells,” have been observed in cobble-gravel channel beds with low bed material transport rates. Experiments show that such structures develop simultaneously with the armor layer during an extended period when flows do not exceed the Shields threshold by more than ∼2 times, so that bed material transport is low. They are constructed by particles moving from less stable positions into more stable configurations against each other. Intermediate developments include clusters and stone lines. They reduce sediment transport by orders of magnitude and are evidently a major stability-promoting mechanism in gravel channels. The timescale for their development suggests that the boundaries of many gravel-bed channels are not in equilibrium with recent competent flows but reflect the history of recent “dominant” flows.},

Complex fluid/particle and particle/particle interactions lead to a broad distribution of transport behaviors under the same set of flow conditions. In this paper, we investigate the plausibility of heavy-tailed movements for particles in bed load transport using carefully controlled flume experiments and theoretical analysis. In our experimental setting, we find travel distances for particles of a given size follow an exponential distribution whose mean varies with grain size. Building on previous work of Stark et al. (2009), we then develop a probability model to show how heavy-tailed distributions of travel distance can emerge from a mixture of particle sizes. Heavy-tailed travel distance can lead to anomalous diffusion in bed load transport, modeled by fractional derivatives in the transport equation.},

@article{Martin2003,
abstract = {Bed load transport formulae have not been tested extensively over medium spatial and temporal scales. The lack of such testing is undoubtedly due to a paucity of field data available for testing at these scales. Extensive transport, morphologic, and discharge data, available for a 10-year period along an 8-km study reach of the Vedder River, British Columbia, are used to test the predictive capabilities of bed load transport formulae at medium scales. The transport data were obtained using the morphologic approach, which is based on the premise that changes in channel morphology reflect the transfer of sediment. Such transport estimates can be made over larger spatial and temporal scales than is possible using traditional measurement techniques. This study focuses on evaluating the original and revised versions of the Bagnold stream power formula, the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula and a stream power correlation. Overall, the formulae are found to underpredict gravel transport rates for the Vedder River. The discrepancy is particularly pronounced in 1982-1983 and 1987-1990, which are periods during which significant dredging occurred. Dredging activity may have loosened the bed structure or resulted in a disequilibrium morphology, thereby increasing sediment movement. Analysis is undertaken to assess how the use of mean daily discharge vs. 15-min increment discharge series affects transport predictions. Results show that only the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula is particularly sensitive to which discharge series is used in calculations. Modification of the Shields parameter is found to significantly affect transport predictions, although it cannot explain alone the discrepancies between field data and calculated results. Predictions of total deposition in the study reach are well within an order-of-magnitude for all equations. The Bagnold-type formulae and the Meyer-Peter and Muller formula do not capture the relatively even distribution of deposition along the study reach. Surprisingly, the simple stream power correlation captured this downstream pattern of deposition. Cumulative distributions of predicted bed load transport are found to be most realistic for the original and revised Bagnold formulae. Results of this study do not suggest that one particular formula is consistently preferred. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {One way to study the mechanism of gravel bed load transport is to seed the bed with marked gravel tracer particles within a chosen patch and to follow the pattern of migration and dispersal of particles from this patch. In this study, we invoke the probabilistic Exner equation for sediment conservation of bed gravel, formulated in terms of the difference between the rate of entrainment of gravel into motion and the rate of deposition from motion. Assuming an active layer formulation, stochasticity in particle motion is introduced by considering the step length (distance traveled by a particle once entrained until it is deposited) as a random variable. For step lengths with a relatively thin (e.g., exponential) tail, the above formulation leads to the standard advection-diffusion equation for tracer dispersal. However, the complexity of rivers, characterized by a broad distribution of particle sizes and extreme flood events, can give rise to a heavy-tailed distribution of step lengths. This consideration leads to an anomalous advection-diffusion equation involving fractional derivatives. By identifying the probabilistic Exner equation as a forward Kolmogorov equation for the location of a randomly selected tracer particle, a stochastic model describing the temporal evolution of the relative concentrations is developed. The normal and anomalous advection-diffusion equations are revealed as its long-time asymptotic solution. Sample numerical results illustrate the large differences that can arise in predicted tracer concentrations under the normal and anomalous diffusion models. They highlight the need for intensive data collection efforts to aid the selection of the appropriate model in real rivers.},

Flume experiments show that the leading front of bed-load on a 20-m-long, mixed-size gravel-bed moves anomalously, where the transient transport rate of the accelerating front varies with the observation time scale. In addition, observations show that moving particles may experience bimodal transport (i.e., coexistence of long trapping time and large jump length) related to bed coarsening and the formation of clusters on a heterogeneous gravel-bed, which is distinguished from the traditional theory of hiding-exposing interactions among mixed-size particles. A fractional derivative model is finally applied to characterize the overall behavior of partial bed-load transport, including the coexistence of the sub-diffusion and non-local feature caused by turbulence and the micro-relief within an armor layer.},

@article{Dietrich1984,
abstract = {Bed load transport in Muddy Creek, Wyoming, a sand-bedded meandering river with equilibrium bottom topography, was found to consist of a zone of maximum sediment flux that shifted across the channel from near the inside bank in the upstream part of the bend toward the pool at the minimum radius of curvature. Significant net cross-stream transport continued even through the crossings between the bends. The downstream bed load transport field for the bend which was studied in greatest detail was the same as that computed from bed form migration measurements and can be predicted from appropriate boundary shear stress data and the Yalin bed load equation. The zone of maximum bed load transport followed an outward-shifting region of maximum boundary shear stress, although in the downstream end of the bend the sediment transport maximum tended to stay closer to the centerline than the boundary shear stress maximum due to particle size influences. Net cross-stream transport varied with particle size and was effected by three major processes: topographically-induced, near-bed, cross-stream flow; trough wise flow along obliquely oriented bed forms; and rolling or avalanching of particles on bed form lee faces plus rolling or mass sliding on a steep cross-stream point bar side slope. Coarse particles were carried outward over the top of the point bar by a near-bed cross-stream flow that was induced by downstream shoaling. These particles then rolled and slid on the point bar side slope and eventually were carried toward the outer bank by troughwise transport along oblique dunes. In the upstream part of the bend, fine particles were carried inward by the channel curvature-induced, near-bed flow and by troughwise transport along lee faces of oblique bed forms. Fine particles and coarse particles crossed paths on top of the point bar, where weak troughwise flow moved just the finer particles toward the convex bank, and on the point bar face, where coarse particles rolled against the secondary circu- lation that was carrying the finer particles. Net cross-stream bed load transport was toward the pool and was on average about 10{\%} of the downstream bed load transport. The Engelund equation predicts reasonably well the general pattern of net cross-stream transport through the meander, but it does not account for the substantial troughwise transport caused by oblique bedforms at several locations in the bend. Our observations suggest that equilibrium bed topography occurs when there is net outward transport into the outward shifting zone of maximum boundary shear stress.},

abstract = {The ability to automatically detect certain types of cells or cellular subunits in microscopy images is of significant interest to a wide range of biomedical research and clinical practices. Cell detection methods have evolved from employing hand-crafted features to deep learning-based techniques. The essential idea of these methods is that their cell classifiers or detectors are trained in the pixel space, where the locations of target cells are labeled. In this paper, we seek a different route and propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based cell detection method that uses encoding of the output pixel space. For the cell detection problem, the output space is the sparsely labeled pixel locations indicating cell centers. We employ random projections to encode the output space to a compressed vector of fixed dimension. Then, CNN regresses this compressed vector from the input pixels. Furthermore, it is possible to stably recover sparse cell locations on the output pixel space from the predicted compressed vector using {\$}L{\_}1{\$}-norm optimization. In the past, output space encoding using compressed sensing (CS) has been used in conjunction with linear and non-linear predictors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful use of CNN with CS-based output space encoding. We made substantial experiments on several benchmark datasets, where the proposed CNN + CS framework (referred to as CNNCS) achieved the highest or at least top-3 performance in terms of F1-score, compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Previous analyses have identified the active width of braided rivers, the bed area over which bed load flux and short-term morphological change occurs, as an important element of braiding dynamics and predictions of bed load flux. Here we compare theoretical predictions of active width in gravel-bed braided rivers with observations from Sunwapta River, and from a generic physical model of gravel braided rivers, to provide general observations of the variation in active width, and to develop an understanding of the causes of variation. Bed topography was surveyed daily along a 150 m reach of the pro-glacial Sunwapta River for a total of four weeks during summer when flow was above threshold for morphological activity. In the laboratory, detailed digital elevation models (DEMs) were derived from photogrammetric survey at regular intervals during a constant discharge run. From the field and flume observations there is considerable local and circumstantial variation in active width, but also a general trend in average active width with increasing discharge. There is also a clear relationship of active width with active braiding index (number of active branches in the braided channel network), and with dimensionless stream power, which appears to be consistent across the range of data from field and physical models. Thus there is a link between active width and the river morphology and dynamics, and the possibility of a general relationship for estimating active width from channel pattern properties or reach-scale stream power values, from which approximate bedload flux calculations may be made. The analysis also raises questions about differences between hydraulically-based numerical model computations of instantaneous active width and observation of time-integrated morphological active width. Understanding these differences can give insight into the nature of bedload transport in braided rivers and the relationship to morphological processes of braiding.

abstract = {Meandering rivers are common on Earth and other planetary surfaces, yet the conditions necessary to maintain meandering channels are unclear. As a consequence, self-maintaining meandering channels with cutoffs have not been reproduced in the laboratory. Such experimental channels are needed to explore mechanisms controlling migration rate, sinuosity, floodplain formation, and planform morphodynamics and to test theories for wavelength and bend propagation. Here we report an experiment in which meandering with near-constant width was maintained during repeated cutoff and regeneration of meander bends. We found that elevated bank strength (provided by alfalfa sprouts) relative to the cohesionless bed material and the blocking of troughs (chutes) in the lee of point bars via suspended sediment deposition were the necessary ingredients to successful meandering. Varying flood discharge was not necessary. Scaling analysis shows that the experimental meander migration was fast compared to most natural channels. This high migration rate caused nearly all of the bedload sediment to exchange laterally, such that bar growth was primarily dependent on bank sediment supplied from upstream lateral migration. The high migration rate may have contributed to the relatively low sinuosity of 1.19, and this suggests that to obtain much higher sinuosity experiments at this scale may have to be conducted for several years. Although patience is required to evolve them, these experimental channels offer the opportunity to explore several fundamental issues about river morphodynamics. Our results also suggest that sand supply may be an essential control in restoring self-maintaining, actively shifting gravel-bedded meanders.},

abstract = {Glasses are rigid, but flow when the temperature is increased. Similarly, granular materials are rigid, but become unjammed and flow if sufficient shear stress is applied. The rigid and flowing phases are strikingly different, yet measurements reveal that the structures of glass and liquid are virtually indistinguishable. It is therefore natural to ask whether there is a structural signature of the jammed granular state that distinguishes it from its flowing counterpart. Here we find evidence for such a signature, by measuring the contact-force distribution between particles during shearing. Because the forces are sensitive to minute variations in particle position, the distribution of forces can serve as a microscope with which to observe correlations in the positions of nearest neighbours. We find a qualitative change in the force distribution at the onset of jamming. If, as has been proposed, the jamming and glass transitions are related, our observation of a structural signature associated with jamming hints at the existence of a similar structural difference at the glass transition--presumably too subtle for conventional scattering techniques to uncover. Our measurements also provide a determination of a granular temperature that is the counterpart in granular systems to the glass-transition temperature in liquids.},

abstract = {1 The relation between equilibrium stream channel morphology and three independent governing variables, discharge, sediment supply, and valley slope, is investigated using a stream table. The experiments are based on a generic physical model of a laterally active gravel bed stream and directed by a recently published rational regime model. While a variety of channel adjustments are possible, the primary adjustment observed was in the channel slope. Other adjustments, such as surface armor composition and cross-sectional shape, were minor in comparison. The equilibrium slope is well predicted by a linear function of sediment concentration which is bounded by two thresholds: one associated with the minimum stream power necessary to deform the bed and the other associated with the maximum sediment feed that can be transported by the available flow. The results suggest that the system tends to move toward the minimum slope capable of transporting the sediment supply, in the process increasing the flow resistance for the system. Whether or not a minimum slope or a maximum system-scale flow resistance is reached cannot be determined given the available data, but there appears to be a unique slope or, at least, a limited range of slopes) for which a stable alluvial channel morphology can be established for a given sediment concentration. The implications of this behavior are evaluated for the theoretical basis of the extremal hypothesis used to close the formulation of a rational regime model.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic modification of forests has often decoupled streams from riparian ecosystems and altered natural wood recruitment processes. Extensive research has shown that large wood significantly impacts channel dynamics, especially in small and intermediate sized forested streams where wood pieces are similar in length to channel width, and many stream rehabilitation efforts now involve the addition of large wood to streams. The primary objective of this research is to investigate the relation between large wood and reach scale channel morphology and hydraulics using a physical model, in order to better inform stream rehabilitation programs and future modeling efforts. Four experiments, each comprising numerous five hour runs, were conducted using a Froude-scaled stream table with wood loads scaled to 0m3/m2, 0.011m3/m2, 0.016m3/m2, and 0.022m3/m2. The addition of large wood significantly decreased the reach-averaged velocity in all experiments, and was associated with decreased sediment transport and increased sediment storage in the reach. Increases in bed and water surface slope compensated for the loss of energy available to transport sediment, and enabled the system to reach a new steady state within the equivalent of 6 to 9years. Adding wood increased pool frequency, as well as the variability in cross-sectional depth, while causing the reach to undergo a transition from a plane-bed to a riffle-pool morphology. Retention of fine sediment increased the availability of fish spawning substrate, while increased water stage improved connectivity between the channel and the floodplain. The changes in habitat complexity were generally related to the wood load added to the reach, but were also dependent on the orientation and arrangement of the pieces. These results demonstrate that wood may exert a primary control on channel morphodynamics and the availability of aquatic habitat in intermediate sized streams, and suggest that the benefits from stream rehabilitation efforts are highly dependent on project scale. The relatively long time needed to realize habitat benefits demonstrates that long term monitoring of rehabilitation projects is necessary. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Physical models of gravel braided rivers were used to investigate the adjustment of braiding intensity to step changes in channel-forming discharge and the mechanisms by which channel pattern adjustment and maintenance occurs. A braided channel developed at low discharge was subjected to two step increases in discharge between which the channel was given time to develop stable average braiding intensity in response to each steady discharge. Active (with visible bed material movement) and total channel networks were mapped throughout the experiment. Total braiding intensity exceeded active braiding intensity and both adjusted to a stable, average value at each discharge, indicating that channel pattern adjustment to total discharge involves both the active and the total network. Only portions of the total braided channel network developed at a given time, and it formed progressively by migration and avulsion of the (less extensive) active network. At equilibrium, the ratio of active to total braiding intensity stabilized at about 0.4. This stable value may increase with relative mobility of the bed material (stream power relative to grain size). The stable value was achieved via gradual increase of total braiding intensity while active braiding intensity adjusted very quickly to the increased flow. These adjustments are controlled by partial avulsion of the main active channel associated with changes in its sinuosity, and allocation of flow and bed load to secondary anabranches. Braided channel pattern dynamics is closely tied to, and explained by, the local dynamics and symmetry/asymmetry of bifurcations and avulsions.},

abstract = {Riparian vegetation can significantly influence the morphology of a river, affecting channel geometry and flow dynamics. To examine the effects of riparian vegetation on gravel bed braided streams, we conducted a series of physical experiments at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory with varying densities of bar and bank vegetation. Water discharge, sediment discharge, and grain size were held constant between runs. For each run, we allowed a braided system to develop, then seeded the flume with alfalfa (Medicago sativa), allowed the seeds to grow, and then continued the run. We collected data on water depth, surface velocity, and bed elevation throughout each run using image- based techniques designed to collect data over a large spatial area with minimal disturbance to the flow. Our results show that the influence of vegetation on overall river patterns varied systematically with the spatial density of plant stems. Vegetation reduced the number of active channels and increased bank stability, leading to lower lateral migration rates, narrower and deeper channels, and increased channel relief. These effects increased with vegetation density. Vegetation influenced flow dynamics, increasing the variance of flow direction in vegetated runs and increasing scour depths through strong downwelling where the flow collided with relatively resistant banks. This oblique bank collision also provides a new mechanism for producing secondary flows. We found it to be more important than the classical curvature-driven mechanism in vegetated runs.},

abstract = {When a system jams, it undergoes a transition from a flowing to a rigid state. Despite this important change in the dynamics, the internal structure of the system remains disordered in the solid as well as the fluid phase. In this way jamming is quite different from crystallization, the other common way in which a fluid solidifies. Jamming is a paradigm for thinking about how many different types of fluids--from molecular liquids to macroscopic granular matter--develop rigidity. Here we review recent work on the jamming transition.We start with perhaps the simplest model: frictionless spheres interacting via repulsive finite-range forces at zero temperature. In this highly idealized case, the transition has aspects of both first- and second-order transitions. From studies of the normal modes of vibration for the marginally jammed solid, new physics has emerged for how a material can be rigid without having the elastic properties of a normal solid. We first survey the simulation data and theoretical arguments that have been proposed to understand this behavior. We then review work that has systematically gone beyond the ideal model to see whether the scenario developed there is more generally applicable. This includes work that examines the effect of nonspherical particles, friction, and temperature on the excitations and the dynamics. We briefly touch on recent laboratory experiments that have begun to make contact with simulations and theory.},

We first show that the bed elevation distribution is close to Gaussian and then investigate gravel-bed roughness using the second-order structure function. The latter reveals two distinct regions: a scaling region at small spatial lags and a saturation region at large scales. The scaling exponent H (a form of Hurst exponent) appears to be isotropic and universal for both manually created "unworked" gravel beds (H = 0.5) and natural water-worked gravel beds (H = 0.79). However, the gravel-bed roughness, in general, is not isotropic and should be characterized by three independent characteristic scales. A simple model of gravel-bed roughness based on the structure function parameterization is developed and compared with the characteristic particle size approach.},

abstract = {[1] We conducted a series of flume experiments to investigate the response of self-formed gravel-bed channels to floods of varying magnitude and duration. Floods were generated by increasing the discharge into a channel created in sand-and gravel-sized sediment with a median grain size of 2 mm. Flooding increased the Shields stress along the channel perimeter, causing bank erosion and rapid channel widening. The sediment introduced to the channel by bank erosion was not necessarily deposited on the channel bed, but was rather transported downstream, a process likely facilitated by transient fining of the bed surface. At the end of each experiment, bank sediments were no longer in motion, " partial bed load transport " characterized the flat-bed portion of the channel, and the Shields stress approached a constant value of 0.056, about 1.2 times the critical Shields stress for incipient motion. Furthermore, the discharge was entirely accommodated by flow within the channel: the creation of a stable channel entirely eliminated overbank flows. We speculate that similar processes may occur in nature, but only where bank sediments are non-cohesive and where channel-narrowing processes cannot counteract bank erosion during overbank flows. We also demonstrate that a simple model of lateral bed load transport can reproduce observed channel widening rates, suggesting that simple methods may be appropriate for predicting width increases in channels with non-cohesive, unvegetated banks, even during overbank flows. Last, we present a model for predicting the equilibrium width and depth of a stable gravel-bed channel with a known channel-forming Shields stress.},

abstract = {A series of laboratory experiments demonstrates that riparian vegetation can cause a braided channel to self-organize to, and maintain, a dynamic, single-thread channel. The initial condition for the experiments was steady-state braiding in non-cohesive sand under uniform discharge. From here, an experiment consisted of repeated cycles alternating a short duration high flow with a long duration low flow, and uniform dispersal of alfalfa seeds over the bed at the end of each high flow. Plants established on freshly deposited bars and areas of braidplain that were unoccupied during low flow. The presence of the plants had the effect of progressively focusing the high flow so that a single dominant channel developed. The single-thread channel self-adjusted to carry the high flow. Vegetation also slowed the rate of bank erosion. Matching of deposition along the point bar with erosion along the outer bend enabled the channel to develop sinuosity and migrate laterally while suppressing channel splitting and the creation of new channel width. The experimental channels spontaneously reproduced many of the mechanisms by which natural meandering channels migrate and maintain a single dominant channel, in particular bend growth and channel cutoff. In contrast with the braided system, where channel switching is a nearly continuous process, vegetation maintained a coherent channel until wholesale diversion of flow via cutoff and/or avulsion occurred, by which point the previous channel tended to be highly unfavorable for flow. Thus vegetation discouraged the coexistence of multiple channels. Varying discharge was key to allowing expression of feedbacks between the plants and the flow and promoting the transition from braiding to a single-thread channel that was then dynamically maintained.},

abstract = {The paper presents the detailed formulation and validation results of simple and robust procedures for the generation of synthetic turbulence aimed at providing artificial turbulent content at the RANS-to-LES interface within a zonal Wall Modelled LES of attached and mildly separated wall-bounded flows. There are two versions of the proce- dure. The aerodynamic version amounts to a minor modification of a synthetic turbulence generator developed by the authors previously, but the acoustically adapted version is new and includes an internal damping layer, where the pressure field is computed by “weight- ing” of the instantaneous pressure fields from LES and RANS. This is motivated by the need to avoid creating spurious noise as part of the turbulence generation. In terms of pure aerodynamics, the validation includes canonical shear flows (developed channel flow, zero pressure gradient boundary layer, and plane mixing layer), as well as a more complex flow over the wall-mounted hump with non-fixed separation and reattachment, with emphasis on a rapid conversion from modeled to resolved Reynolds stresses. The aeroacoustic applica- tions include the flow past a trailing edge and over a two-element airfoil configuration. In all cases the methodology ensures a very acceptable accuracy for the mean flow, turbulent statistics and, also, the near- and far-field noise. Keywords},

abstract = {ed load transport is a highly stochastic, multiscale process, where particle advection and diffusion regimes are governed by the dynamics of each sediment grain during its motion and resting states. Having a quantitative understanding of the macroscale behavior emerging from the microscale interactions is important for proper model selection in the absence of individual grain‐scale observations. Here we develop a semimechanistic sediment transport model based on individual particle dynamics, which incorporates the episodic movement (steps separated by rests) of sediment particles and study their macroscale behavior. By incorporating different types of probability distribution functions (PDFs) of particle resting times urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr21990:wrcr21990-math-0001, under the assumption of thin‐tailed PDF of particle velocities, we study the emergent behavior of particle advection and diffusion regimes across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. For exponential PDFs of resting times urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr21990:wrcr21990-math-0002, we observe normal advection and diffusion at long time scales. For a power‐law PDF of resting times (i.e., urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr21990:wrcr21990-math-0003), the tail thickness parameter urn:x-wiley:00431397:media:wrcr21990:wrcr21990-math-0004 is observed to affect the advection regimes (both sub and normal advective), and the diffusion regimes (both subdiffusive and superdiffusive). By comparing our semimechanistic model with two random walk models in the literature, we further suggest that in order to reproduce accurately the emerging diffusive regimes, the resting time model has to be coupled with a particle motion model able to produce finite particle velocities during steps, as the episodic model discussed here.},

abstract = {This article examines the spatial dynamics of bed load particles in water. We focus particularly on the fluctuations of particle activity, which is defined as the number of moving particles per unit bed length. Based on a stochastic model recently proposed by Ancey and Heyman (2014), we derive the second moment of particle activity analytically, that is, the spatial correlation functions of particle activity. From these expressions, we show that large moving particle clusters can develop spatially. Also, we provide evidence that fluctuations of particle activity are scale dependent. Two characteristic lengths emerge from the model: a saturation length ..sat describing the length needed for a perturbation in particle activity to relax to the homogeneous solution and a correlation length ..c describing the typical size of moving particle clusters. A dimensionless Peclet number can also be defined according to the transport model. Three different experimental data sets are used to test the theoretical results. We show that the stochastic model describes spatial patterns of particle activity well at all scales. In particular, we show that ..c and ..sat may be relatively large compared to typical scales encountered in bed load experiments (grain diameter, water depth, bed form wavelength, flume length, etc.) suggesting that the spatial fluctuations of particle activity have a nonnegligible impact on the average transport process.},

abstract = {In gravel-bed rivers, bedload transport exhibits considerable variability in time and space. Recently, stochastic bedload transport theories have been developed to address the mechanisms and effects of bedload transport fluctuations. Stochastic models involve parameters such as particle diffusivity, entrainment and deposition rates. The lack of hard information on how these parameters vary with flow conditions is a clear impediment to their application to real-world scenarios. In this paper, we determined the closure equations for the above parameters from laboratory experiments. We focused on shallow supercritical flow on a sloping mobile bed in straight channels, a setting that was representative of flow conditions in mountain rivers. Experiments were run at low sediment transport rates under steady nonuniform flow conditions (i.e., the water discharge was kept constant, but bedforms developed and migrated upstream, making flow nonuniform). Using image processing, we reconstructed particle paths to deduce the particle velocity and its probability distribution, particle diffusivity, and rates of deposition and entrainment. We found that on average, particle acceleration, velocity and deposition rate were responsive to local flow conditions, whereas entrainment rate depended strongly on local bed activity. Particle diffusivity varied linearly with the depth-averaged flow velocity. The empirical probability distribution of particle velocity was well approximated by a Gaussian distribution when all particle positions were considered together. In contrast, the particles located in close vicinity to the bed had exponentially distributed velocities. Our experimental results provide closure equations for stochastic or deterministic bedload transport models.},

Morphological style is determined chiefly by the caliber and quantity of sediment delivered to the channel, although modulated by channel scale. Yet the relations between sediment transport and river morphol-ogy have received only limited, qualitative attention. In this review, the problem is studied by defining sediment transport regimes on the basis of the Shields number, a nondimensional measure of the capacity of the channel to move sediment of a given caliber. The problem is also approached from an inverse perspective by which the quantity and character of sediment deposits are used to infer details about the vari-ation of sediment transport and sedimentation along a channel. Coupling the two approaches establishes a basis to gain new insights into the origins of alluvial channel morphology.},

abstract = {Grains of a single size within a mixed-size bed are entrained over a range of flows. Within this range some grains exposed on the bed surface are active (entrained at least once over the duration of a transport event), while the remaining surface grains are immobile, a condition we define as partial transport. We demonstrate the existence and domain of partial transport using observations of grain entrainment on time series of bed photographs of flume experiments with a widely sorted sand/gravel mixture. The active proportion of the bed surface increases with bed shear stress tau(0). At a given tau(0), 90{\%} of the active grains are entrained when the cumulative mass transported exceeds approximately 4 times the active mass on the bed. Mobilization of grains in a size fraction increases from 10{\%} to 90{\%} over a range of tau(0) of a factor of 2. The bounds of this range increase with grain size D-i so that at a given tau(0), sizes over a range of a factor of 4 are in a state of partial transport. Fractional transport rates are independent of D-i for fully mobilized fractions and decrease rapidly with D-i for partially mobile fractions. partial transport is associated with substantial transport rates of finer, fully mobile sizes, limits both the rate and size distribution of grain exchange with the bed subsurface, and may be the dominant transport condition in many gravel-bed rivers.},

abstract = {By trapping sediment in reservoirs, dams interrupt the continuity of sediment transport through rivers, resulting in loss of reservoir storage and reduced usable life, and depriving downstream reaches of sediments essential for channel form and aquatic habitats. With the acceleration of new dam construction globally, these impacts are increasingly widespread. There are proven techniques to pass sediment through or around reservoirs, to preserve reservoir capacity and to minimize downstream impacts, but they are not applied in many situations where they would be effective. This paper summarizes collective experience from five continents in managing reservoir sediments and mitigating downstream sediment starvation. Where geometry is favorable it is often possible to bypass sediment around the reservoir, which avoids reservoir sedimentation and supplies sediment to downstream reaches with rates and timing similar to pre-dam conditions. Sluicing (or drawdown routing) permits sediment to be transported through the reservoir rapidly to avoid sedimentation during high flows; it requires relatively large capacity outlets. Drawdown flushing involves scouring and re-suspending sediment deposited in the reservoir and transporting it downstream through low-level gates in the dam; it works best in narrow reservoirs with steep longitudinal gradients and with flow velocities maintained above the threshold to transport sediment. Turbidity currents can often be vented through the dam, with the advantage that the reservoir need not be drawn down to pass sediment. In planning dams, we recommend that these sediment management approaches be utilized where possible to sustain reservoir capacity and minimize environmental impacts of dams.},

abstract = {Bedload and river morphology interact in a strong feedback manner. Bedload conditions the development of river morphology along different space and time scales; however, by concentrating the flow in preferential paths, a given morphology controls bedload for a given discharge. As bedload is a non-linear response of shear stress, local morphology is likely to have a strong impact on bedload prediction when the shear stress is averaged over the section, as is usually done. This was investigated by comparing bedloadmeasured in different bedmorphologies (step-pool, plane bed, riffle-pool, braiding, and sand beds), with bedloadmeasured in narrowflumes in the absence of any bed form, used here as a reference. The initialmethodology consisted of fitting a bedload equation to the flume data. Secondly, themorphological signature of each river was studied as the distance to this referent equation. It was concluded that each morphology affects bedload in a different way. For a given average grain shear stress, the larger the river, the larger the deviation fromthe flume transport. Narrow streams are thosemorphologies that behave more like flumes; this is particularly true with flat beds, whereas results deviate from flumes to a greater extent in step-pools. The riffle-pool's morphology impacts bedload at different levels depending on the degree of bar development, considered here through the ratio D84/D50 which is used as a proxy for the local bed patchiness and morphology. In braiding riversmorphological effects are important but difficult to assess because width is dependent on transport rate. Bedmorphologywas found to have negligible effects in sand bed rivers where the Shields stress is usually sufficiently high to minimize the non-linearity effects when hydraulics is averaged over the section.},

abstract = {Water and sediment inputs are fundamental drivers of river ecosystems, but river management tends to emphasize flow regime at the expense of sediment regime. In an effort to frame a more inclusive paradigm for river management, we discuss sediment inputs, transport, and storage within river systems; interactions among water, sediment, and valley context; and the need to broaden the natural flow regime concept. Explicitly incorporating sediment is challenging, because sediment is supplied, transported, and stored by nonlinear and episodic processes operating at different temporal and spatial scales than water and because sediment regimes have been highly altered by humans. Nevertheless, managing for a desired balance between sediment supply and transport capacity is not only tractable, given current geomorphic process knowledge, but also essential because of the importance of sediment regimes to aquatic and riparian ecosystems, the physical template of which depends on sediment-driven river structure and function.},

abstract = {We present a new random walk model for bed load sediment transport that explains the scale-dependency generally observed in transport rates and captures the transient anomalous dispersion often seen in rivers. Particles alternate between mobile and resting phases, with a tempered stable probability distribution for both particle step length and resting time. Tempered fractional mobile-immobile differential equations model the ensemble average of particle dynamics. The model is tested against data from three sediment dispersion experiments. Using tempering in both space and time, the new model is able to capture the full range of observed ensemble particle dynamics. The random walk model illuminates the physical meaning of all transport parameters in the mobile-immobile equations and explains transitions between observed super-diffusive, sub-diffusive, and regular diffusive ensemble particle dynamics. By explicitly predicting the effects of spatial and temporal averaging on particle dynamics, this method can be used to link observations of fluvial sediment dynamics across scales. This approach is also generally applicable to a wide variety of geophysical and ecological dynamics, such as ecological dispersal, pathogen transmission in rivers, nutrient export from watersheds, and large-scale geomorphodynamics associated with infrequent phenomena such as avalanches and turbidity currents.},

abstract = {This paper concerns a model of bed load transport, which describes the advection and dispersion of coarse particles carried by a turbulent water stream. The challenge is to develop a microstructural approach that, on the one hand, yields a parsimonious description of particle transport at the microscopic scale and, on the other hand, leads to averaged equations at the macroscopic scale that can be consistently interpreted in light of the continuum equations used in hydraulics. The cornerstone of the theory is the proper determination of the particle flux fluctuations. Apart from turbulence-induced noise, fluctuations in the particle transport rate are generated by particle exchanges with the bed consisting of particle entrainment and deposition. At the particle scale, the evolution of the number of moving particles can be described probabilistically using a coupled set of reaction–diffusion master equations. Theoretically, this is interesting but impractical, as solving the governing equations is fraught with difficulty. Using the Poisson representation, we show that these multivariate master equations can be converted into Fokker–Planck equations without any simplifying approximations. Thus, in the continuum limit, we end up with a Langevin-like stochastic partial differential equation that governs the time and space variations of the probability density function for the number of moving particles. For steady-state flow conditions and a fixed control volume, the probability distributions of the number of moving particles and the particle flux can be calculated analytically. Taking the average of the microscopic governing equations leads to an average mass conservation equation, which takes the form of the classic Exner equation under certain conditions carefully addressed in the paper. Analysis also highlights the specific part played by a process we refer to as collective entrainment, i.e. a nonlinear feedback process in particle entrainment. In the absence of collective entrainment the fluctuations in the number of moving particles are Poissonian, which implies that at the macroscopic scale they act as white noise that mediates bed evolution. In contrast, when collective entrainment occurs, large non-Poissonian fluctuations arise, with the important consequence that the evolution at the macroscopic scale may depart significantly that predicted by the averaged Exner equation. Comparison with experimental data gives satisfactory results for steady-state flows.},

abstract = {Existing bed-load transport formulas may overestimate the transport rate in mountain rivers by two orders of magnitude or more. Recently published field data sets provide an opportunity to take a fresh look at the bed-load transport relationship and it is hypothesized that the overestimate is due to a failure to account for the effect of a coarse surface layer of bed material inhibiting the release of fine subsurface material. Bed-load transport is determined as gs=aq−qc where qwater discharge per unit width; qccritical value for initiation of bed material movement; water density; and acoefficient. The gs /q relationship is typically piecewise linear, characterized by two transport phases with, respectively, low and high rates of change. Twenty-one flume and 25 field data sets were used to quantify the relationship for Phase 2. The flume data confirm the dependence of a on S1.5, where Schannel slope, in agreement with earlier studies. The field data additionally show that a varies inversely with the degree of bed armoring, given by the ratio of surface to subsurface bed material size. The finding is consistent with the hypothesis and suggests the need to account for the bed material supply limitation in the bed-load transport formula. However, the available data are not entirely sufficient to rule out an alternative dependency, or codependency, on flow resistance. The critical conditions for initiation of Phase 2 transport are also quantified as a function of bed material size and channel slope. The resulting set of equations allows a more accurate estimation of Phase 2 bed-load transport rates. However, the equations are empirical and should be restricted for use within the range of conditions used in their development, to determine mean rather than instantaneous transport rates and to determine bulk transport rates, not transport by size fraction.},

Morphological style is determined chiefly by the caliber and quantity of sediment delivered to the channel, although modulated by channel scale. Yet the relations between sediment transport and river morphol-ogy have received only limited, qualitative attention. In this review, the problem is studied by defining sediment transport regimes on the basis of the Shields number, a nondimensional measure of the capacity of the channel to move sediment of a given caliber. The problem is also approached from an inverse perspective by which the quantity and character of sediment deposits are used to infer details about the vari-ation of sediment transport and sedimentation along a channel. Coupling the two approaches establishes a basis to gain new insights into the origins of alluvial channel morphology.},

abstract = {Modern geomorphology was founded in the nineteenth century as an exercise of historical interpretation of landscapes. After the mid-twentieth century it dominantly became a quest to understand the processes by which landscapes are modified. This focused attention on the measurement of sediment fluxes on synoptic timescales and on a reductionist, Newtonian programme of construction of low-order theories about those fluxes, largely imported from engineering science. The period also saw the emergence of an applied geomor-phology. Toward the end of the twentieth century the subject was dramatically transformed by improved technologies for remote sensing and surveying of Earth's surface, the advent of personal computation and of large-scale computation, and important developments of absolute dating techniques. These technical inno-vations in turn promoted recognition of geomorphology as a 'system science' and facilitated the reintegration of tectonics into geomorphology, opening the way for a renewed consideration of the history of the land-scape. Finally, increasing recognition of the dominance of human agency in contemporary modification of Earth's terrestrial surface has become a significant theme. Important influences on the continuing develop-ment of the subject will include the search for physically sound laws for material fluxes; reconciling geomor-phological information and process representations across spatial and temporal scales, in both observation and theory; comprehending complexity in geomorphological processes and landform histories; incorporating the geomorphological role of living organisms, particularly micro-organisms; understanding the role of cli-mate in geomorphology, both in the contemporary changing climate and in the long term; and fully admitting the now dominant role of humans as geomorphic agents. Geomorphology is simultaneously developing in diverse directions: on one hand, it is becoming a more rigorous geophysical science – a significant part of a larger earth science discipline; on another, it is becoming more concerned with human social and economic values, with environmental change, conservation ethics, with the human impact on environment, and with issues of social justice and equity.

abstract = {To clarify the grain-scale mechanisms that control the onset and cessation of sediment transport, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of granular beds driven by a model hydrodynamic shear flow. We find a critical value for the Shields number (the nondimensional shear stress at the top of the granular bed) that separates flowing and static states, with a bed flow rate that is discontinuous at the critical value. The transition times between flowing and static states diverge as the system approaches the critical Shields number from above and below. Additionally we find that, for finite systems, the onset of flow occurs stochastically at supercritical Shields numbers. We show that the statistics of the Shields number at failure obey Weibullian weakest-link statistics, and that the onset of flow is caused by local grain rearrangements that give rise to additional rearrangements and then to continuous flow. Thus, the onset of motion is governed by the packing structure of the granular bed, even deep beneath the surface. Since the fluid dynamics is strongly coupled to the settling process and thus to the bed structure, this also suggests a strong feedback between the fluid dynamics and granular physics in bed mobilization.},

abstract = {This study addresses the rotting and lifting probabilities for sediment entrainment by incorporating the probabilistic features of the turbulent fluctuation and bed grain geometry. The lognormally distributed instantaneous velocity and uniformly distributed initial grain position, along with a relation between lift coefficient and particle Reynolds number, are used to extend the theoretical formulation of the entrainment probabilities in smooth-bed flows. The two threshold conditions identified herein enable us to precisely define the probabilities of entrainment in the rolling and lifting modes. The results obtained in this study coincide well with the published data. The lifting probability increases monotonously with the dimensionless shear stress theta, which is consistent with the earlier results yet displays improved agreement with the experimental data. The maximum value of rolling probability, with a magnitude of 0.25, occurs at theta approximate to0.15. For theta{\textless}0.05 (or {\&}theta;{\textgreater}0.6), the rotting (or lifting) probability makes up more than 90{\%} of the total entrainment probability and thus can be used as an approximation to the total probability of entrainment. The proposed rolling and lifting probabilities are further linked to the two separate criteria for incipient motion to explore the critical entrainment probabilities. The results reveal that a consistent probability corresponding to the critical state of sediment entrainment cannot be found.},

abstract = {A continuous record reveals that the incidence of bedload in a coarse-grained river channel changes from flood to flood. Long periods of inactivity encourage the channel bed to consolidate sufficiently so that bedload is largely confined to the recession limb of the next flood-wave. But when flood's follow each other closely, the bed material is comparatively loose and offers less resistance to entrainment. In this case, substantial amounts of bedload are generated on the rising limb. This is confirmed by values of bed shear stress or stream power at the threshold of initial motion which can be up to five times the overall mean in the case of isolated floods or those which are the first of the season. This produces a complicated relationship between flow parameters and bedload and explains some of the difficulties in establishing bedload rating curves for coarse-grained channels. Besides this, the threshold of initial motion is shown to occur at levels of bed shear stress three times those at the thresholds offinal motion. This adds further confusion to attempts at developing predictive bedload equations and clearly indicates at least one reason why equations currently in use are unsatisfactory. Bedload is shown to be characterized by a series of pulses with a mean periodicity of 1.7 hours. In the absence of migrating bedforms, it is speculated that this well-documented pattern reflects the passage of kinematic waves of particles in a slow-moving traction carpet. The general pattern of bedload, including pulsations, is shown to occur more or less synchronously at different points across the stream channel.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The importance of particle-particle collisions in sediment saltation in the bed-load layer is analyzed herein by means of numerical simulation. The particle saltation theoretical/numerical model follows a Lagrangian approach, and addresses the motion of sediment particles in an open channel flow described by a logarithmic velocity profile. The model is validated with experimental data obtained from the literature. In order to evaluate the importance of the phenomenon, simulations with and without particle-particle collisions were carried out. Results for two different sediment concentrations are presented, namely 0.13{\%} and 2.33{\%}. For each concentration of particles, three different flow intensities were considered, and trajectories of two different particle sizes, within the sand range were computed. Changes in particle rotation, particle velocity, and angle of trajectory before and after particle-particle collisions appear to be relatively important at lower shear stresses, whereas they decrease in significance with increasing flow intensities. Analyses of the evolution in time of the second order moment of particle location suggest that inter-particle collisions introduce transverse diffusion in saltating particles in the span-wise direction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In order to effectively simulate this important problem avoiding exces- sive computational costs, we followed a decoupled approach, which uses a computed turbulent velocity field for a smooth flat plate as a surrogate of the three-dimensional (3D) turbulent conditions close to the bed in streams. Because these two flows are not the same, we first tested that the basic turbulence statistics for this velocity field did not differ significantly from those in an open-channel flow. We then tracked particles with a 3D Lagrangian model. The Lagrangian model also includes the calculation of the particle rotation and a generalized algorithm for particle collisions with walls and with other par- ticles. Numerical simulations of several particle sizes were performed and the results were compared with previous experimental data, with good agreement.},

abstract = {Research examining the hydraulics, morphology, and stability of step-pool mountain streams has blossomed in the last decade, resulting in more than a dozen dissertations. These, along with other research projects, have transformed our understanding of step-pool channels. Contributions have been made toward understanding depositional step formation and destruction, scour downstream of steps, step-pool hydraulics, and the effect of sediment transport on step stability. We propose that depositional steps exist in a jammed state whereby the boulders are structurally arranged within the channel and thereby stabilize it. Once a step has formed, a scour pool with a characteristic length and depth develops downstream, creating a zone where additional steps are unlikely to occur. Downstream of the scour hole, steps are more likely to occur as the high energy associated with the plunge pool has dissipated. Data suggest that the presence of cobbles or boulders limits pool scour as well as the degree to which well-defined, channel-spanning step-pools form. We propose a state-space for step-pools in which conditions for a step to form include (1) the ratio between width and boulder diameter (the jamming ratio), (2) the ratio between applied shear stress and the stress needed to mobilize the bed (relative Shields number), and (3) the ratio between bed material supply and discharge (bed sediment concentration). Available data suggest this model is plausible. Emerging critical research questions are discussed.},

abstract = {Desert ephemeral gravel bed streams typically have bed surfaces that are relatively unarmored compared to the substrate below, while gravel bed streams in humid and snowmelt areas typically have well-armored surfaces. The degree of armoring can be characterized in terms of an armor ratio defined as the ratio of the surface median size to the substrate median size. A set of field data shows desert ephemeral gravel bed streams with armor ratios ranging from 0.5 to 2.4 and with an average value of 1.2. The armor ratio of snowmelt-fed gravel bed streams in the same set ranges from 2 to 7, with an average value of 3.4. The reason for this difference is sought in terms of differing hydrological characteristics and sediment supply regimes. Thirteen experiments were conducted to study the formation of armoring under a range of hydrological conditions. The experiments have two limiting cases: a relatively flat hydrograph that represents conditions produced by continuous snowmelt and a sharply peaked hydrograph that represents conditions associated with flash floods. All constant hydrograph experiments developed a well-armored structured surface, while short asymmetrical hydrographs did not result in substantial vertical sorting. All symmetrical hydrographs show some degree of sorting, and the sorting tended to become more pronounced with longer duration. Sediment supply appears to be a first-order control on bed surface armoring, while the shape of the hydrograph plays a secondary role.},

abstract = {Inflow discharge and outflow stage estimates for hydraulic flood models are generally derived from river gauge data. Uncertainties in the measured inflow data and the neglect of rainfall-runoff contributions to the modeled domain downstream of the gauging locations can have a significant impact on these estimated “whole reach” inflows and consequently on flood predictions. In this study, a method to incorporate rating curve uncertainty and local rainfall-runoff dynamics into the predictions of a reach-scale flood model is proposed. The methodology is applied to the July 2007 floods of the River Severn in UK. Discharge uncertainty bounds are generated applying a nonparametric local weighted regression approach to stage-discharge measurements for two gauging stations. Measured rainfall downstream from these locations is used as input to a series of subcatchment regional hydrological model to quantify additional local inflows along the main channel. A regional simplified-physics hydraulic model is then applied to combine these contributions and generate an ensemble of discharge and water elevation time series at the boundaries of a local-scale high complexity hydraulic model. Finally, the effect of these rainfall dynamics and uncertain boundary conditions are evaluated on the local-scale model. Accurate prediction of the flood peak was obtained with the proposed method, which was only possible by resolving the additional complexity of the extreme rainfall contributions over the modeled area. The findings highlight the importance of estimating boundary condition uncertainty and local rainfall contributions for accurate prediction of river flows and inundation at regional scales.},

The data are fitted to an equation representing the tempo- ral in-stream gas exchange as it responds to the diurnal temperature fluctuation. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated by collecting and analyzing samples at six different stream locations across parts of north- ern Virginia, USA. The studied streams drain watersheds with areas of between 2 and 122 km2 during peri- ods when the diurnal stream temperature ranged between 2 and 58C.

abstract = {At the smallest scales of sediment transport in rivers, the coherent structures of the turbulent boundary layer constitute the fundamental mechanisms of bedload transport, locally increasing the instantaneous hydrodynamic forces acting on sediment particles, and mobilizing them downstream. Near the critical threshold for initiating sediment motion, the interactions of the particles with these unsteady coherent structures and with other sedi-ment grains, produce localized transport events with brief episodes of collective motion occurring due to the near-bed velocity fluctuations. Simulations of these flows pose a significant challenge for numerical models aimed at capturing the physical processes and complex non-linear interactions that generate highly intermittent and self-similar bedload transport fluxes. In this investigation we carry out direct numerical simulations of the flow in a rectangular flat-bed channel, at a Reynolds number equal to Re = 3632, coupled with the discrete element method to simulate the dynamics of spherical particles near the bed. We perform two-way coupled Lagrangian simulations of 48,510 sediment particles, with 4851 fixed particles to account for bed roughness. Our simulations consider a total of eight different values of the non-dimensional Shields parameter to study the evolution of transport statistics. From the trajectory and velocity of each sediment particle, we compute the changes in the probability distribution functions of velocities, bed activity, and jump lengths as the Shields number increases. For the lower shear stresses, the intermittency of the global bedload transport flux is described by computing the singularity or multifr actal spectrum of transport, which also characterizes the widespread range of transport event magnitudes. These findings can help to identify the mechanisms of sediment transport at the particle scale. The statistical analysis can also be used as an ingredient to develop larger, upscaled models for predicting mean transport rates, considering the variability of entrainment and deposition that characterizes the transport near the threshold of motion.},

abstract = {Bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers impacts channel stability, the lifespan of hydraulic structures, physical components of aquatic habitat, and long-term channel evolution. Field measurements of bedload transport are notoriously difficult, which precludes understanding many of the processes and mechanics associated with grain motion. Such uncertainties are exacerbated when using bedload transport equations, most of which were derived using data from a single river or set of laboratory flume experiments. Recently, laboratory experiments have focused on better quantifying the processes that impact bedload fluxes, which can then be used to improve sediment transport predictions. We highlight recent advances in laboratory instrumentation that can be used in bedload transport studies. In particular, more accurate ways to measure bedload fluxes, near-bed turbulence, bed grain sizes, and topography hold great promise. Laboratory experiments have also fundamentally improved our understanding of the influence of sediment supply and armoring processes on bedload fluxes and channel conditions. The importance of flow hydrographs in controlling total bedload transport rates and bedload hysteresis has also been demonstrated using flume experiments. Finally, many details about the mechanics of grain motion including flow turbulence, bed arrangement, and particle transport statistics are only possible through laboratory investigations, and we feature key knowledge gaps that can be improved with further study.},

@article{Redolfi2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018. American Geophysical Union. Measurement and estimation of bed load transport in gravel bed rivers are highly affected by its temporal fluctuations. Such variability is primarily driven by the flow regime but is also associated with a variety of inherent channel processes, such as flow turbulence, grain entrainment, and bed forms migration. These internal and external controls often act at comparable time scales, and are therefore difficult to disentangle, thus hindering the study of bed load variability under unsteady flow regime. In this paper, we report on laboratory experiments performed in a large, mobile bed flume where typical hydromorphological conditions of gravel bed rivers were reproduced. Data from a large number of replicated runs, including triangular and square-wave hydrographs, were used to build a statistically sound description of sediment transport processes. We found that the inherent variability of bed load flux strongly depends on the sampling interval, and it is significantly higher in complex, wandering or braided channels. This variability can be filtered out by computing the mean response over the experimental replicates, which allows us to highlight two distinctive phenomena: (i) an overshooting (undershooting) response of the mean bed load flux to a sudden increase (decrease) of discharge, and (ii) a clockwise hysteresis in the sediment rating curve. We then provide an interpretation of these findings through a conceptual mathematical model, showing how both phenomena are associated with a lagging morphological adaptation to unsteady flow. Overall, this work provides basic information for evaluating, monitoring, and managing gravel transport in morphologically active rivers.},

It is therefore proposed here that the use of turbulence sequences, instead of single instantaneous extreme events, is more appropriate for characterizing the role of fluctuating velocities and associated hydrodynamic forces on particle mobility. The validity of the proposed method is examined through the detailed analysis of directly measured velocity and pressure data sets. In an effort to relate the results of the conventional velocity quadrant analysis with the instantaneous pressure measurements, the concept of pressure quadrant analysis is introduced. The coupled sequences of the synchronous velocity and pressure quadrant events allow for a more complete description of the local turbulent flow characteristics, including the prevalent coherent structures, and more clear interpretation of their role on particle mobility. It is concluded here that large-scale sweep structures are capable of generating excessive and persistent force fluctuations which are predominantly responsible for the dynamic process of particle dislodgement. This result supports the impulse criterion as the proper way of accounting for the cumulative effect of coherent structures on particle movement.},

For almost a century, this onset has been treated as a discontinuous transition at which hydrodynamic forces overcome gravity-loaded grain-grain friction. Using a custom laminar-shear flume to image slow granular dynamics deep into the bed, here we find that the onset is instead a continuous transition from creeping to granular flow. This transition occurs inside the dense granular bed at a critical viscous number, similar to granular flows and colloidal suspensions and inconsistent with hydrodynamic frameworks. We propose a new phase diagram for sediment transport, where 'bed load' is a dense granular flow bounded by creep below and suspension above. Creep is characteristic of disordered solids and reminiscent of soil diffusion on hillslopes. Results provide new predictions for the onset and dynamics of sediment transport that challenge existing models.},

abstract = {Excess sediment production in the upper parts of catchments may result in important impacts over morphodynamics of gravel bed-rivers. By changing morphodynamics, sediment overfeed-ing may induce important changes in the structure of near-bed flow, mainly in what concerns exchange of momentum and mass between flow within the roughness elements and flow in the upper regions. It is not well-known how turbulent statistics, including those characterizing the bursting cycle, are affected by bed load transport, for mobile but geometrically similar beds. This study addresses this issue. It is aimed at evaluating the impacts of sediment transport on flow hydrodynamics, namely on statistics of turbulent coherent structures. In order to accomplish the proposed objective, laboratory tests were undertaken. Two-dimensional instantaneous flow velocity fields in the stream-wise and vertical directions were meas-ured with Particle Image Velocimetry. Two laboratory tests simulated a framework gravel bed with sand matrix and a framework gravel bed with sand matrix but with sediment transport imposed at near capacity conditions. The framework con-sists of coarse gravel whose diameters range between 0.5 cm and 7 cm and is kept immobile under the imposed flow conditions. The mobile sediments are sand with a mean diameter of 0.9 mm. For both tests, the quadrant threshold analysis technique was employed and shear stress distribution statistics were ana-lyzed and discussed in what concerns their contribution and persistence. In the case of mobile conditions, sweep events tend to govern the flow in the near-bed region. Relevant differences between mobile and sub-threshold beds are found in the wake of roughness elements, mostly for sweep statistics. In the presence of bed-load, ejection events decrease their participation in the shear stress production processes. This decrease in the ejection events contribution is partially balanced with an increase in the frequency of inward events. concluded that the presence of intense intermittent sediment transport increases the extreme values of shear stress while the flow becomes more organ-ized in the second and fourth quadrants, mainly increasing the importance of sweep events to tur-bulence production, while Ferreira et al. (2009) sug-gested that further research was needed to clarify the nature of feedback effects between turbulent flow organization and sediment fluxes. Fundamental questions remain unsolved in what concerns flow organization under sediment transport conditions, specially in ejections and sweep events which are the major contribuitors to the Reynolds shear stress production among the bursting cycle.

abstract = {Virtual process engineering (VPE) aims to redefine the roadmap for process scaling-up and optimization, from stepwise experiments to high-performance computer simulations. This is a long-cherished dream of chemical engineers, but requires high standards of Accuracy (the agreement between the simulation and the real process), Capability (the computational speed, scale, and resolution of the simulation), and Efficiency (cost-effective and easy to use), in short, ACE. For complex processes such as gas–solid fluidization, the gap between state-of-the-art simulations and VPE is still huge in terms of ACE. However, the work reported in this paper narrows this gap significantly. In this study, a coarse-grained discrete particle method (DPM) defined by the energy-minimization multi-scale (EMMS) model is deployed for high-resolution simulations of fluidized beds, with the gas- and solid-phase equations solved concurrently by CPUs and GPUs in a heterogeneous supercomputing system. With systematic optimization of the model, numerical method, software, and hardware, we are able to simulate lab- to pilot-scale fluidized beds at quasi-realtime speed, and conduct virtual experiments on such systems. This enables very-long-time simulations to obtain important engineering parameters such as the particle residence time distribution, attrition and deactivation indexes. This work demonstrates that the industrial application of VPE is almost on the horizon.},

abstract = {Results from several applications of particle image velocimetry (PIV) to unsteady flows at a laboratory scale have been published, and commercial products are now available for more general laboratory use, but for certain industrially important applications, reliable equipment is often available only from in-house research and development teams. This PIV handbookis intended to transfer know-how from PIV development laboratories to end-users in industry and universities. The book discusses the scientific and technical aspects required to set up a PIV system, allows users to assess the problems involved in the application of PIV, and enables them to design, optimize, and use PIV systems to meet their special needs.},

@article{Plimpton1995,
abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently—those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers--the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed.},
